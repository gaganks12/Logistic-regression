Mortgage,Conventional home mortgage,Closing on a mortgage,,"We have already tried to contact the company with the following complaint 3 times using different avenues. In the most recent email sent, we requested that they contact us to at least acknowledge that the complaint was received. We have gotten no responses since the complaint was first filed three weeks ago. The text of the submitted complaint follows. 

To whom it may concern : We are writing to submit a formal complaint regarding the poor service that we received while working with XXXX XXXX XXXX/Closing Mark Home Loan. We are strongly considering submitting a formal complaint to the  Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and any similar state agency in Colorado and/or California, as we feel that there were instances that pushed the boundaries of acceptable and, possible, legal behavior. 
The entire loan process with this company, from start to finish, has been unprofessional at best to downright deceptive and, potentially, life-impacting. We have been forgotten, lied to, and put into stressful situations that, frankly, should never happen. We have been through multiple account officers and underwriters, been asked to submit documents multiple times, been told falsehoods, and, upon completing closing on XX/XX/XXXX, we received letters that appeared to be informing us that we had been denied for the loan that we closed on. 
The following is a summarized narrative of the timeline from starting the prequalification process to closing on the mortgage. This timeline has been compiled based upon timestamped communication ( both written and digital ). 
We started this journey in XX/XX/2019, upon starting the prequalification process. We submitted the requested information to XXXX XXXX XXXX ( herein after XXXX )  and promptly received a response on XX/XX/XXXX. At that time, we received an initial workbook which showed us the expected loan amount, down payment amount, fees, etc. The individual that we started with was extremely responsive and helpful, answering any of our questions promptly and clearly. 
We toured the community and decided that it was a good fit for us. At that time, we were given the option of looking for outside financing options or pursuing financing with the related company, XXXX ; the related financing came with builder incentives. At no point were we pressured by the sales team at XXXX to go with XXXX. However, as we had already started the prequalification process ( and the subsequent hard hit to our credit scores ) and because of the very good service we had received to date, as well as the healthy builder incentive, we signed the sales contract with the commitment to pursue the mortgage through XXXX. The contract was completed on XX/XX/XXXX, following a discussion with both the sales team at XXXX and the XXXX representative. 
On XX/XX/XXXX ( a Saturday ), we reached out to the XXXX representative to see what the next financing steps would be, as the sales team indicated that the mortgage company would reach out to us. The next day ( a Sunday ), the XXXX representative informed us that he would be running an automated approval and would reach out if he needed additional documents. We took this to mean that our application was complete enough to start the clock and was in process. At this point, we had not been told that additional documents would be required to complete our application, just that there may be a need for additional documentation. 
We did not hear back from the XXXX representative after that point. On XX/XX/XXXX ( a Saturday, nearly two full calendar weeks from last contact ), we reached out to the XXXX representative again. By XX/XX/XXXX ( Wednesday ), we emailed the XXXX sales team for assistance ; they referred us to the president of the mortgage company. We were informed, by the president of the company, that the XXXX representative that had been handling our application had abruptly left XXXX and that our application had not been passed onto another case manager/loan officer. By that time, our required loan approval date had passed ; this date was stipulated in our sales contract. 
We were connected with a new XXXX representative ( herein after referred to as new XXXX representative or loan officer ) who informed us via email that our application was incomplete and that nothing had been processed in the intervening time. Again, we had been under the impression that our application was complete and in process since mid-XXXX. At that point, again, nearly two weeks had passed, and we did not receive a formal notification of incompleteness. 
During the subsequent document collection period, the loan officer asked we could put down another half percent, which would increase our down payment to 3.5 % of the sales price. We agreed that we could afford the extra 0.5 %, but asked if she was considering an FHA loan. She informed us that she was looking at that option. At that point, we stated that we did not want to pursue an FHA loan, but said that we would consider it if we could see all the financing options that she could offer us. We asked that we be provided with a worksheet showing all the offerings that we could qualify for, so that we could pick the option that best matched our needs. We never received a product comparison worksheet despite the written request. Additionally, we did not receive an updated worksheet showing our expected costs at this time. 

Subsequently, as we were loading additional documents into the XXXX portal when we noticed that we had a loan details section available. We opened that section of the webpage and saw that our loan had been started under an FHA program, despite the fact that we had told our loan officer that we did not want an FHA loan and despite the fact that we had not been given a worksheet showing our product options. We communicated to the loan officer that we emphatically did not want the FHA loan, as the fees associated with the loan would negate any benefit from going with XXXX, based upon the builder incentives. Additionally, both of us have strong credit scores and did not need the credit support to qualify for a mortgage. Instead of giving us a workbook showing us our different financing options, the loan officer changed the product type for the mortgage to a XXXX  XXXX  conventional loan. Again, at no point were we allowed to select our product type ( or informed that XXXX only offered a limited product selection ). We were not given the information needed to make an informed decision. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, we received the first set of loan disclosure documents ; we were not talked through our product choices at this point. We promptly signed the loan disclosures, after saving a copy and reviewing in detail. At this point, we received our first estimate ( aside from the prequalification estimate provided in XXXX ) that showed our expected loan costs, rate, fees, etc. This information was not provided ahead of time and we were informed that we had only 72 hours to sign the documents. We were not given options on product type or any other factor. Additionally, we were not offered any assistance in understanding the documents that we were given or any help working through the legalese. 

It should be noted that we were informed, only by the disclosures, that the PMI would not be cancellable due to rising home values. At the outset, the original XXXX  representative implied ( though, notably, did not explicitly state ), that the home could be reappraised after a period of time and the new value used for the LTV calculation. Under the subsequent disclosures, it was apparent that the PMI could only cancellable via loan payments compared to the original appraised value at closing. While not a major issue, it is notable because it is contradictory to information that we had at outset. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, we received an automated email informing us that we had updated disclosures to sign. The email did not indicate what the changes were, nor did the loan officer notify us at any point that changes had been made. Upon reviewing the disclosures, the changes were the addition of a TILA form ( that we did not receive in our original packet ), an additional {$200.00} fee, and the removal of our {$5000.00} earnest money deposit. As a result, our updated disclosures indicated that we would owe an additional {$5000.00} in cash for our down payment at closing.

We reached out the same date to the loan officer and received a response that equated to her not knowing what was going on. Upon further research, she informed us that she wasnt sure why the earnest money deposit was removed and that she would make sure that we would get updated documents showing the amount. We were told to be confident that the credit would be given at closing. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, we were introduced via email to a loan processor ( herein after loan processor or underwriter ; this introduction came directly from the loan processor and the loan officer was not involved in the introduction. At this time, the loan processor stated that our loan was conditionally approved, dependent upon two document lists. One list was to be provided as soon as possible, while the other was due within 60 days of closing. At this point, we were at about a month and a half out from the point at which we had been originally led to believe that our application was complete.

Many of the documents requested at this time had already been submitted as part of our original loan package or the subsequent package initiated by the loan officer. We had to resend many of the documents and enter them onto an online portal. 

It should be noted, at this point, we sent images ( pictures ) of several of the documents to the loan processor. This was not an issue and she did not request that the documents be scanned or otherwise in a different format. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, we began reaching out to the loan officer to get information for the mortgagee clause, as our insurance agent was requesting it before he could start the formal application and estimate process on his side. The next day, we were informed that a new loan processor ( different from the current underwriter ) would provide that information to our agent. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, we reached out to the loan processor, as we had not heard from her since we submitted our documents ( largely completed in XXXX ). On XX/XX/XXXX, she responded and said that she received all our documents that that everything looks good at this time. She said that she would reach out closer to closing, but did not state why. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, we received an email from the loan officer informing us that XXXX had acquired Closing Mark Home Loans ( herein after CMHL ) and that our mortgage application would be acquired by CMHL. The email stated that our mortgage would be redisclosed and that we would need to sign updated disclosures. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, we received a notification from CMHL stating that the XXXX mortgage application had been migrated to the new platform. We received new loan disclosures at that time. 

The XX/XX/XXXX letter informed us that we would be receiving an updated conditional approval. This is a month after we had originally been conditionally approved. The loan officer did not reach out to explain that a new application had been started on the new platform, hence the approval process was started over entirely. The document informed us that our application was started XX/XX/XXXX, though it was not explicitly made clear that it was a completely new loan application and not just a formality due to the new system. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, we received the formal scheduling request for closing, via Closing Mark Settlement Services. While this was scheduled, we had not yet received a formal approval, final disclosures, or closing instructions. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, we received 3 options for the interest rate lock. The option sheet was sent only with instructions to look at Options 1, 2 and 3, with no explanation for the calculations, differences, or any other factors. Upon reviewing them, the only option that we could follow the math on was Option 3. Given the previous difficulties in obtaining information from the loan officer, we decided to lock on the option that we could follow. Based on our math, the other two options did not appear to conform to standard amortization at the listed interest rates, but, again, we could not follow the math. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, we received our updated disclosures for the interest rate lock. This disclosure, like previous disclosures, did not have any charge for points. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, we received an email from the president of the mortgage company. This email informed us that XXXX was legally required to close out the application and that we would soon be receiving a notice from XXXX  that would show that XXXX  no longer had an active application in the system for us ; the email stated that the communication that we would receive could include language stated that the application was denied, but that it would not impact our ongoing application with CMHL. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, we received a Changed Circumstance letter. This letter added a {$770.00} fee, amounting to 0.25 % of the loan amount, as points, as part of the origination costs. This fee was not explained to us. The letter stated that it was due to the credit report/credit score and credit report/mortgage insurance. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, we received an email titled XXXX/XXXX XXXX XXXX Conditional Loan Approval. This email included a list of new documents to provide, including new disclosures, new bank statements, new paystubs, insurance quote, and college transcripts. It should be noted that we were told, in the body of the email, that the documents needed to be provided asap. At this point, we were not offered a secure way to send our documents. We could email them back to the loan processor directly or fax them. 

At this point, we were also informed that we could not send pictures of documents to the loan processor, despite having been able to send images previously. While navigable, this put a fair amount of undue pressure on us, as we had to find a way to scan our documents to be able to send them via email. We also found that we had a significant amount of pressure from the loan processor to provide the documents quickly On XX/XX/XXXX, we received disclosures to sign. On XX/XX/XXXX, we emailed the loan officer and asked if the disclosures were the final set and if the listed cash to close amount was the amount we needed to get our cashiers check for closing. We were informed that the disclosures given were the final set. 

The XX/XX/XXXX documents additionally included a waiver for the receipt of the appraisal within the timing required by ECOA section 1002.14 ( a ) ( 1 ). 

On XX/XX/XXXX, we received the appraisal on the property. This property appraisal had been completed on XX/XX/XXXX. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, we emailed our loan officer to ask about what name to put on the cashiers check for closing, as we never received closing instructions. While this email was sent on a Saturday, we had previously received prompt responses from all parties, even on weekends. We had no reason to believe that we would not hear back prior to closing on XX/XX/XXXX. 

We received no further communication from the mortgage company, nor any of its agents, prior to closing. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, we closed on the mortgage. Our appointment to close was at XXXX. We arrived at approximately XXXX, as our previous meeting for the day had ended more quickly than expected. We were prepared to wait until XXXX. Our closing agent came out at around XXXX and told us that our application had not yet been approved by CMHL and that she was, as a result, still, waiting for documents. She also informed us that she had not yet received the final closing disclosure and that, as a result, our cash to close amount had not yet ben finalized. 

At about XXXX, our closing agent informed us that she had received several closing disclosures for our application that day. She then stated that the final closing amount had been set by CMHL, as she had confirmed the most recent disclosure with the wire processor. We were short on our original check ( which was stated as the final amount, as previously noted ) and were forced to go back to our bank. We had to come up with about {$800.00} on the spot to be able to close. At this point, our closing documents were not yet available. 

We signed our documents at our XXXX PM on XX/XX/XXXX. We waited at the settlement office until nearly XXXX XXXX for the final wire to be sent by the processing agent. We were given no explanation for the significant wait. 

After closing, we returned to our then-current residence for the night. We checked our mail. We found two letters which were mailed to us ( one for each of us ), which stated that our loan had been denied. The letters were dated XX/XX/XXXX, but had not been mailed and post-marked until XX/XX/XXXX. These letters were related to the hand-off from XXXX to CMHL. As previously noted, we had been told in XXXX that we may receive a formal denial letter, due to the new application being opened. As given by the discrepancy between the letter and postmark dates, it appears that these letters were held back for some reason. The reason was not given to us at any point in the application process. 

The following day, XX/XX/XXXX, we received an email from our loan officer apologizing for the delay in response to our question regarding our closing and a statement that she hoped our closing went okay. No comments were included regarding the fact that our loan had not been approved for the day of closing. We did not respond. 

In summary, the entire process was fraught and full of miscommunications and a lack of communication. Our grievances are summarized below : Our application was forgotten by the mortgage company, as the original representative left and nobody picked up his caseload. 
Our application was implied to have been complete and in process with the original representative. 
o At no point did we receive a formal notice of incompleteness, despite ongoing requests for information over several months. 
o We were not given a complete checklist of all the information that we would need to provide throughout the life of the application and approval process. 
We were not given product comparisons between available options, despite multiple requests for such information. 
We were originally put into a product type that we explicitly stated that we did not want. 
o While we do not know the details of the XXXX/CMHL compensation structure, we have been informed by multiple individuals from outside financial institutions that FHA loans often generate a larger incentive fee for the loan officer. We believe that this could be the reason for the initial assignment.

We were given contradictory information throughout the process. This includes receiving documents which did not include {$5000.00} in cash we had already paid ; while this was resolved, this issue was never explained to us.

We were not given explanations for multiple adjustments and changes to fees and amounts through out the process.

o Our loan officer did not make any attempt to explain any of the forms, procedures, or documents that we received. We were forced to make our best attempt at understanding the files that we had to sign. 
o When setting our rate lock, the loan officer did not explain the difference between the given options. As previously stated, two of the options did not mathematically calculate to the payments given.

o We are better informed than most consumers, as one of us works for a commercial bank. Even then, we had trouble with some of the documents and it is baffling that we received no guidance from the loan officer.

We were denied a secure way to send documents to the loan processor.

o Additionally, a format which had previously been acceptable for files, was no longer acceptable. We were not given an explanation for this discrepancy. 
We were not given closing instructions. When we reached out for instructions ( admitted at the 11th hour ), we did not receive a response. This is out of line with prior behavior, as we had previously received prompt communication even outside of normal business hours. 
o The response from the lender was given a business day after our closing. It should be noted that this response did not include any of the requested information. 
Our loan was not approved prior to the day of our closing and, in actuality, we had to wait for the application to be approved and for documents to be prepared and sent to our closing agent. 
o While we are not sure of the industry standard for loan approvals and preparation of loan documents for mortgages, it does not seem unreasonable to expect that the process should be completed well prior to the day of closing. 
o This caused a significant amount of personal stress, as our closing agent could not give us an expected timeline. We were left unaware of if we were going to be able to close on our scheduled date or if we would need to be rescheduled. 
This is significant, as we had already made arrangements for our moving process, including cancelling our lease with our prior residence, booking and prepaying for moving equipment, and taking time off from work ( including taking time for the day of closing itself ). 
We received a formal loan denial after our closing, with the denial letters being sent on XX/XX/XXXX. Given that XX/XX/XXXX was a holiday, it seems likely that the letters were sent so as to not be received until after closing.

"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports",Credit reporting,Incorrect information on your report,Information belongs to someone else,"Accounts added and/or created unbeknownst to me Notice to whom it be of concern, It is YOU I hold accountable and accuse of complicity in exercise of malevolent did-compliance. I hereby mark you as likely one that I might one day view in civil discord as the "" would be plaintiffs '', yet I declare to you your unjust claim is to be met with deliberate and determined resistance and counteraction. In is in clarity that your Claim of Non-Medical debt Collection is insufficient for collections much less reporting. You MUST DELETE this unjust injurious allegation because it is significantly deficient of the requisite certified reporting compliance ( such as perfect metro 2 format reporting ) and testimonial evidence of the PHYSICALLY VERIFIABLE PROOF OF VALIDATION as related to the full truth, accuracy, completeness, timeliness, ownership, identity of true debtor, dates, balances, audits, calculations, source codes, creditor collection code, 426-chrc P6 statement and its associated trailing fragments, the minimal five portioned personal identifiers, the pay statuses, the required 386-pieces of confirmation to collection, and elsewise standard or mandatory for proper reporting, mentioned or not. 



Although I am checking for and addressing missing and or deficient aspects of REPORTING COMPLIANCES and not contesting any debt of compliant nature, I should make you aware that since unlawful reporting transitions collection into an equally not complaint circumstance. Being still yet not validated by document fact in compliance to requisite standards, it is to be announced yet again that legally I have no knowledge of the validity of the alleged claims of delinquency and or derogatory nature, nor of the certifiably compliant matter to either any of its collection attempts and or its reporting despite previous consumer filed composed complaints checking for each. Might it be known, especially shall I elect to take this matter up to a civil court, any debt and or derogatory claim must be pursued ( particularly for collection ) in a very defined and precisely compliant and physically verifiable or certifiable manner as detailed in the requisite obeyed federal and state collection and reporting regulations associated with any of the above noted said claim ( s ) to include but not limited to the FCBA, FCRA, HIPAA PRIVACY RULE, FACTA, FDCPA and TCPA, etc. ADDITIONALLY, if an entity acts as a collector and also elects to act as a reporting party of consumer credit they must as well adhere to every single one even each any and all of the regulatory reporting requisites and standards of reporting with legal standing in full accordance of laws and accepted reporting standards. To date, the plaintiff has failed to demonstrate any capacity or willingness to validate the alleged debt much less certify the fair, accurate, complete and compliant reporting of the claims, particularly being significantly deficient is any display of certified metro 2 compliance. As such, given the fact of recent breaches of information collection repositories, I am hesitating to readily accept what is presented without testimonial and certified physically verifiable document evidence of claim as being legitimate. I deny nothing, yet I reserve the right to question any unproven claim. I do NOT accept the statement of claim of the plaintiff and I call for the court to reject their claim as untrue, unverified, incomplete, not compliant or otherwise invalid and thereby reject-able and dischargeable which requirement to be dismissed in full. I demand said court resolution today, even here and now in full accords of regulatory statutes, mentioned by me or not. 


1 ) To date, I have received no knowledge of ever entering into any contractual relationship with the to-be plaintiff ( s ) { should I forward into a civil complaint } or with the entity ( ies ) that allegedly issued against me the defaulted line of credit ( s ) or accusations similar. This despite repeated calls to the accusers to demonstrate the requisite presented physically verifiable document proof of adequately acquired permissible purpose from the exactly and only individual irrefutably identified as being me. I have no acknowledgement of a relationship with the parties mentioned, in any form. 


2 ) I have no knowledge of ever knowingly acknowledging ( or even unknowingly doing so ) that I owe any proven and compliantly reported debt, much less the claim of unproven debt alleged in this written declaration CHECKING for not only VALIDITY of CLAIMS but also DOCUMENT PROOF IN CERTIFIABLE TESTIMONY as to the factual and complete COMPLIANCE to all standards and laws, even the mandatory Metro 2 Format Compliance. Its obvious that the allegations filed by the accusers ( or to-be plaintiff ) are in clear subterfuge of act, be it in willful disregard of ethical practices or be it done so in ignorance of requisite ethical and regulatory compliant behavior during their accusations, collection efforts and credit reporting of claims. The vile nature of their derelict is unjustly injurious and unlawful no doubt. I again call for a dismissal of to-be plaintiffs statement of claim ( s ) and discharge of misreported delinquencies and derogatory behavior that the accusers complaint is undeniably unfairly lodged versus me. 


3 ) I have no knowledge of ever receiving any proven or document facts in statement of account or account aspects for these items of alleged debt and delinquent actions. Again, I reiterate I have called on the accusers to present to be document certifiably true, correct, complete, and adequately compliant documentation in full validation of claims, rights to collect alleged claims, and rights to report alleged claims. Let it be true that COMPLIANCE of regulatory requisites is MANDATORY not OPTIONAL. Plaintiffs claims are mute of legal standing in full accordance of law and must be dismissed. 


4 ) I have no knowledge of ever entering into an open account with to-be Plaintiff ( s ) or with the entity ( ies ) that allegedly issued me the defaulted line of credit ( s ) or derogatory claims of credit. 


5 ) FACT IS, no claim above has even submitted adequate compliant proof of the genesis of any consumer/creditor relationship and their inability to prove application, permissible purpose for said alleged application, consumer/creditor agreement in contract describing a relationship related to alleged claim of account and or debt ( s ), and or otherwise derelict documentation of claim ( s ) inherently makes invalid the to-be Plaintiffs whole statement of claim in this summons or complaint. I request court to resolve adequately and compliantly as required with the immediate eradication of complaint charge ( s ) and rectification of any injurious collection or reporting practices. Again, COMPLIANCE of APPROPRIATE COLLECTION PRACTICES and equally COMPLIANCE of APPROPRIATE and COMPLETE REPORTING PRACTICES is MANDATORY, NOT OPTIONAL. 


6 ) As it stands, until PROVEN OTHERWISE, the complaining to-be Plaintiff ( s ) does so unjustly, unethically, and likely illegally so in absolute deficiency of requisite legal standing in full accordance of applicable laws ( mentioned or not ), both to collection practices and as well with reporting practices, particularly in the inability or unwillingness to timely and fully certify physically verifiable document proof in full validity of debt claim or compliance of reporting, even to the mandatory Metro 2 format. As such, here again I declare my right and preference to stand against all claims of the to-be Plaintiff ( s ) and call on your authority and INTEGRITY to ensure truth of claim, correctness of claim, completeness of claim, ownership and responsibility of any debt ( s ) or delinquencies of debt alleged in above noted claim ( s ), perfect and prove-able compliance of collection actions related to claim ( s ), and compliance of reporting actions related to claim ( s ) ... ... ... ... ... ... ..",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,"TRANSUNION INTERMEDIATE HOLDINGS, INC.",FL,327XX,,Consent provided,Web,24/10/2019,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,3416197

Mortgage,Conventional home mortgage,Trouble during payment process,,"I have been trying to get my Private Mortgage Insurance Removed from my mortgage since XX/XX/XXXX when my mortgage dropped below 80 % loan to value. Last year my mortgage was sold from XXXX XXXX  ( Under mortgage # XXXX ) to Ditech Mortgage ( account # XXXX ). I reached out to Ditech via a email ( after being told to do so via phone representative ) request to remove my PMI on mortgage on XX/XX/XXXX and received no response at all from them, I even checked my junk box and nothing was there. My mortgage papers that I signed state an "" Automatic Termination of PMI '' that states once my loan is below 78 % loan to value PMI will automatically terminate ( I have attached this document ). I reached out again today on XX/XX/XXXX to make this request via phone and was told initially to send the request that I already sent it too. I asked to speak with a supervisor and after being put on hold for about 30 minutes, I finally spoke to one. They told me that my loan to value must be under 70 % loan to value and that was their policy. After reading this document to the supervisor, I was told that "" they don't have that document on file ''. She ( XXXX XXXX ) sent me a link to send her the form I have. I did so and just told me that I'll be hearing from them in 7-10 business days. Given their past history, I highly doubt that I will hear from them. I did mention to the supervisor and ask her why they weren't staying compliant to the homeowners protection act and she said nothing. From my understand this act requires mortgage companies to drop off PMI once loans are below 78 % LTV and the loan is current.

Mortgage,VA mortgage,Struggling to pay mortgage,,"I am filing this complaint after receiving a letter from Chase today alleging a lie to cover up their illegal activities. In the letter ( see attachment ) dated XX/XX/XXXX Chase asserted that we cant consider you for mortgage assistance because we didnt receive your initial request by the required number of days before the scheduled foreclosure date. THIS STATEMENT IS A LIE. I REPEAT. THIS STATEMENT IS A LIE, AND I CAN PROVE IT! 
Chase has repeatedly made false allegations like this to us for more than four years. Most of the Chase Request for Mortgage Assistance applications we have sent to Chase have been ignored ( see attachment ). Nonetheless, In XX/XX/XXXX, our Chase dedicated relationship manager in XXXX, Florida spoke to the Chase branch bank manager and vice president in XXXX, Georgia. He ( the vice president ) told her ( our dedicated relationship manager ) that he personally faxed all of our documents to her the previous week and confirmed their receipt in her office at that time. In spite of this fact, she requested through the branch bank vice president that we submit our application and all required documents to her again for the 33rd time in 18 months ( see attachment ). Consequently, our dedicated relationship manager sent to our home address a XXXX envelope for us to submit our application and documents back to her again. We sealed the documents in that envelope and took it back to the Chase branch bank so that Chase employees could send it to her through XXXX. 
The Chase branch bank in XXXX, Georgia took receipt of our envelope of documents and gave them to XXXX. XXXX tracking confirms that our application was received by our dedicated relationship manager in her actual office on XX/XX/XXXX at XXXX XXXX ( see attachment ). After that date, we never heard from our dedicated relationship manager again regarding ANY aspect of our application. 
Chase proceeded in XXXX to schedule a foreclosure on our property for XX/XX/XXXX in violation of the laws of our state for multiple reasons, including failure to provide proper notification as required by law. As such, this proves the statement made by Chase to us in their letter dated XX/XX/XXXX is a lie because we submitted our Request for Mortgage Assistance application to Chase more than thirty days before Chase took illegal action to attempt a foreclosure on the date of XX/XX/XXXX. Our "" dedicated relationship manager '' failed to process our application despite our having previously submitted it to her in XX/XX/XXXX, and well as on 32 previous occasions in the past 18 months.",,JPMORGAN CHASE & CO.,GA,305XX,Servicemember,Consent provided,Web,4/03/2019,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,3169014

She has cost me 2 jobs, by showing up and harassing me. I have evidence of this. She has opened 3 accounts in my name. If have no problem paying these if I could maintain a job. My vehicle was intentionally damaged. Sugar was poured into the gas tank. It caused over {$2000.00} in damage. She disputed 3 payments made through an account that she had used to pay with. She was listed as on the vehicle account as a driver, and on the auto insurance, which she also disputed 2 payments. After which she reported to the auto finance company the location of my vehicle and said to repo it. Then bragged about lying and what she had done one social media. I've since made the repairs using what saved money I have. I'm having troubles catching the vehicle up in order to use it as transportation to an from work. I'm a XXXX   XXXX, and can make money with or with out a job. It's just she to the personal attacks from this individual I'm currently in a circle of dept that has locked my ability to grasp how and what to do to overcome it. I need advise or help. Recently I made {$800.00} in payments to get the vehicle under 90 days past due. Toyota told me they would give me options after I did that, and vehicle would be taken out of repo status. They denyed my request to move the past due amount to the back of the dept like they agreed. Then sent a repo agent to claim the vehicle. I denyed then the vehicle. And will continue to do so. I've worked hard to buy, keep, maintain, and repair my vehicle. I'm still behind exactly what was disputed. I'm only weeks from fully financially collapsing and losing my home and everything.

I called Barclay Card to have it corrected and they said that I had to submit letter, via regular mail, and all of the supporting documentation to have my daughters credit reporting reversed. 

Their fraudulent mistake is not my problem to fix. Barclay Card acknowledges that they should not be reporting on my daughters credit report. They should not have reported it to her credit bureau while she was using the card and they certainly should not be reporting it now. However, they said they will maintain the fraudulent reporting unless I write them a letter with all the required documentation to have it removed. 

This is the exact kind of bullying behavior a big bank is supposed to have stopped a long time ago. So they have made an error and now it is MY problem to fix it. Unacceptable. And Illegal. 

Barclay Card has my complaint and my daughter 's complaint by phone and now through this correspondence. If they do not correct the erroneous reporting in a reasonable amount of time I will be forced to take more serious actions regarding the fraud they have committed against my daughter. Not to mention the illegal release of information about my account to her ( she should have never known the balance of my card at anytime, ever ). 

In my conversation with two Barclay representatives on the phone this evening both confirmed that the reporting should not have occurred as she was merely an authorized user with no responsibility for the credit and that the only way I can correct a credit reporting error, even if it is completely their fault, is in writing to a mailing address with supporting documentation which includes my daughter sending them, by mail, a full copy of the erroneous credit reporting. That exposes my family to unnecessary risk. The credit report they want me to send through the mail has all types of personally identifiable information contained within it.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,BARCLAYS BANK DELAWARE,CO,801XX,Servicemember,Consent provided,Web,20/02/2019,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,3156589

Checking or savings account,Checking account,Managing an account,Cashing a check,"Capital One mailed me a closeout check on or around XX/XX/XXXX, received on XX/XX/XXXX, deposited to my XXXX XXXX account on XX/XX/XXXX. Capital One chose to place a stop payment prematurely on the check and in error, they will not admit to this error plainly, will rather state "" Expectations not set correctly '' as reason for stop payment. A second check was expedited via XXXX second day air and rep ( s ) did not allow enough mail time for prior check before reissuing and thus stopping payment.. The check amount, XXXX, represents the remaining balance in my checking account ending in XXXX. Replacement check was sent on XX/XX/XXXX and delivered on XX/XX/XXXX. I left for XXXX XXXX on this day, was not at my address to receive/sign for it or sign check itself. 

XXXX XXXX with XXXX XXXX XXXX picked me up, drove me to XXXX XXXX XXXX at XXXX XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX. I have a statement from Mr XXXX stating he picked me up on said date and time. Please see attached document from Mr XXXX, he can be reached at XXXX. I was in XXXX XXXX from XX/XX/XXXX to XXXX. 

I received information from a XXXX with leadership team at Capital One stating said check was intercepted and signed by a XXXX XXXX whom does not live here, cashed at a XXXX XXXX XXXX which is not my account and do not bank there. A XXXX XXXX with Capital One has replied in re about this, stating the person, XXXX XXXX, lives at my address and the XXXX XXXX Bank account is or was linked to my Capital One account at some point. She also refers to a check deposited to my account from this person sometime ago. My account is now closed and It appears Capital One chose to close it due to account security, they saw the linked account, which I am not aware of, as a possible risk. It appears someone had hacked into my account at some point, added XXXX XXXX account and also used my account to cash a check in the past. Neither of these two incidents are related to loss of funds or constitute receipt of them. 

If Capital One will check signatures on check received on XX/XX/XXXX and replacement check delivered on XX/XX/XXXX, they will see signatures are different from another. Also, another check from Capital One covering overdraft and return check fees relating to stop payment shows my true and correct signature, as does the check received on XX/XX/XXXX which was deposited to my XXXX account and is now closed due to overdrawn status. The overdraft is a result of Capital One stopping payment prematurely as stated prior. I've requested Capital One check signatures, XXXX XXXX did not comply. For argument sake and figuratively speaking even if the person, XXXX XXXX, is related, does not mean funds were not stolen from me as they in fact were..

I request someone in office of the President look into this matter which has been ongoing since late XX/XX/XXXX/early XX/XX/XXXX. To avoid investigating signatures as requested, Capital One chooses to mark complaints as duplicate to avoid doing so. They requested additional time to reply to a prior complaint, which took over a month and then turned around, marked it as duplicate.",,CAPITAL ONE FINANCIAL CORPORATION,CT,6320,,Consent provided,Web,29/01/2019,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,3136706

"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports",Credit reporting,Incorrect information on your report,Information belongs to someone else,"Accounts added and/or created unbeknownst to me Notice to whom it be of concern, It is YOU I hold accountable and accuse of complicity in exercise of malevolent did-compliance. I hereby mark you as likely one that I might one day view in civil discord as the "" would be plaintiffs '', yet I declare to you your unjust claim is to be met with deliberate and determined resistance and counteraction. In is in clarity that your Claim of Non-Medical debt Collection is insufficient for collections much less reporting. You MUST DELETE this unjust injurious allegation because it is significantly deficient of the requisite certified reporting compliance ( such as perfect metro 2 format reporting ) and testimonial evidence of the PHYSICALLY VERIFIABLE PROOF OF VALIDATION as related to the full truth, accuracy, completeness, timeliness, ownership, identity of true debtor, dates, balances, audits, calculations, source codes, creditor collection code, 426-chrc P6 statement and its associated trailing fragments, the minimal five portioned personal identifiers, the pay statuses, the required 386-pieces of confirmation to collection, and elsewise standard or mandatory for proper reporting, mentioned or not.

Although I am checking for and addressing missing and or deficient aspects of REPORTING COMPLIANCES and not contesting any debt of compliant nature, I should make you aware that since unlawful reporting transitions collection into an equally not complaint circumstance. Being still yet not validated by document fact in compliance to requisite standards, it is to be announced yet again that legally I have no knowledge of the validity of the alleged claims of delinquency and or derogatory nature, nor of the certifiably compliant matter to either any of its collection attempts and or its reporting despite previous consumer filed composed complaints checking for each. Might it be known, especially shall I elect to take this matter up to a civil court, any debt and or derogatory claim must be pursued ( particularly for collection ) in a very defined and precisely compliant and physically verifiable or certifiable manner as detailed in the requisite obeyed federal and state collection and reporting regulations associated with any of the above noted said claim ( s ) to include but not limited to the FCBA, FCRA, HIPAA PRIVACY RULE, FACTA, FDCPA and TCPA, etc. ADDITIONALLY, if an entity acts as a collector and also elects to act as a reporting party of consumer credit they must as well adhere to every single one even each any and all of the regulatory reporting requisites and standards of reporting with legal standing in full accordance of laws and accepted reporting standards. To date, the plaintiff has failed to demonstrate any capacity or willingness to validate the alleged debt much less certify the fair, accurate, complete and compliant reporting of the claims, particularly being significantly deficient is any display of certified metro 2 compliance. As such, given the fact of recent breaches of information collection repositories, I am hesitating to readily accept what is presented without testimonial and certified physically verifiable document evidence of claim as being legitimate. I deny nothing, yet I reserve the right to question any unproven claim. I do NOT accept the statement of claim of the plaintiff and I call for the court to reject their claim as untrue, unverified, incomplete, not compliant or otherwise invalid and thereby reject-able and dischargeable which requirement to be dismissed in full. I demand said court resolution today, even here and now in full accords of regulatory statutes, mentioned by me or not.

1 ) To date, I have received no knowledge of ever entering into any contractual relationship with the to-be plaintiff ( s ) { should I forward into a civil complaint } or with the entity ( ies ) that allegedly issued against me the defaulted line of credit ( s ) or accusations similar. This despite repeated calls to the accusers to demonstrate the requisite presented physically verifiable document proof of adequately acquired permissible purpose from the exactly and only individual irrefutably identified as being me. I have no acknowledgement of a relationship with the parties mentioned, in any form.

2 ) I have no knowledge of ever knowingly acknowledging ( or even unknowingly doing so ) that I owe any proven and compliantly reported debt, much less the claim of unproven debt alleged in this written declaration CHECKING for not only VALIDITY of CLAIMS but also DOCUMENT PROOF IN CERTIFIABLE TESTIMONY as to the factual and complete COMPLIANCE to all standards and laws, even the mandatory Metro 2 Format Compliance. Its obvious that the allegations filed by the accusers ( or to-be plaintiff ) are in clear subterfuge of act, be it in willful disregard of ethical practices or be it done so in ignorance of requisite ethical and regulatory compliant behavior during their accusations, collection efforts and credit reporting of claims. The vile nature of their derelict is unjustly injurious and unlawful no doubt. I again call for a dismissal of to-be plaintiffs statement of claim ( s ) and discharge of misreported delinquencies and derogatory behavior that the accusers complaint is undeniably unfairly lodged versus me.

3 ) I have no knowledge of ever receiving any proven or document facts in statement of account or account aspects for these items of alleged debt and delinquent actions. Again, I reiterate I have called on the accusers to present to be document certifiably true, correct, complete, and adequately compliant documentation in full validation of claims, rights to collect alleged claims, and rights to report alleged claims. Let it be true that COMPLIANCE of regulatory requisites is MANDATORY not OPTIONAL. Plaintiffs claims are mute of legal standing in full accordance of law and must be dismissed.

4 ) I have no knowledge of ever entering into an open account with to-be Plaintiff ( s ) or with the entity ( ies ) that allegedly issued me the defaulted line of credit ( s ) or derogatory claims of credit.

5 ) FACT IS, no claim above has even submitted adequate compliant proof of the genesis of any consumer/creditor relationship and their inability to prove application, permissible purpose for said alleged application, consumer/creditor agreement in contract describing a relationship related to alleged claim of account and or debt ( s ), and or otherwise derelict documentation of claim ( s ) inherently makes invalid the to-be Plaintiffs whole statement of claim in this summons or complaint. I request court to resolve adequately and compliantly as required with the immediate eradication of complaint charge ( s ) and rectification of any injurious collection or reporting practices. Again, COMPLIANCE of APPROPRIATE COLLECTION PRACTICES and equally COMPLIANCE of APPROPRIATE and COMPLETE REPORTING PRACTICES is MANDATORY, NOT OPTIONAL.

6 ) As it stands, until PROVEN OTHERWISE, the complaining to-be Plaintiff ( s ) does so unjustly, unethically, and likely illegally so in absolute deficiency of requisite legal standing in full accordance of applicable laws ( mentioned or not ), both to collection practices and as well with reporting practices, particularly in the inability or unwillingness to timely and fully certify physically verifiable document proof in full validity of debt claim or compliance of reporting, even to the mandatory Metro 2 format. As such, here again I declare my right and preference to stand against all claims of the to-be Plaintiff ( s ) and call on your authority and INTEGRITY to ensure truth of claim, correctness of claim, completeness of claim, ownership and responsibility of any debt ( s ) or delinquencies of debt alleged in above noted claim ( s ), perfect and prove-able compliance of collection actions related to claim ( s ), and compliance of reporting actions related to claim ( s ) ... ... ... ... ... ... ..",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,"TRANSUNION INTERMEDIATE HOLDINGS, INC.",FL,328XX,,Consent provided,Web,19/09/2019,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,3379394

Student loan,Federal student loan servicing,Dealing with your lender or servicer,Don't agree with the fees charged,"I had to take out loans to attend college part time from XXXX. 
I attended different colleges. XXXX XXXX XXXX College, XXXX XXXX University, XXXX University, and lastly XXXX XXXX University. 

Therefore, I had subsidized and unsubsidized loans approximately {$39000.00} in repayment. In 2009, due to a work injury, I had major XXXX XXXX and the following years I was unable to work to my full capacity just part time Throughout the process, I contacted Navient and XXXX to go into deferrements or pay reduced amounts. Yet the last 10 years despite many letters I sent to fix/refund lost processing delays, late fees and possible misapplied payments NO adjustment was made to go back and review my loans since XXXX. 

Ive tried through many phone calls, faxes and written letters and nothing was done. Now I would love to redeem their lack of follow through when students go through something this hard. 
Thanks in advance for the follow up. I sincerely hope this can be related to Student Loan Departments so they stop costing students unnessary fees. 

Thank you.

Debt collection,I do not know,Took or threatened to take negative or legal action,Threatened or suggested your credit would be damaged,"On XX/XX/2019, I received the letter from Bilateral Credit Collection Company Which I have no idea who they are and there letter was written as XX/XX/2019. They were saying that I owe about {$18000.00} and respond us back urgent. They called me mulitple times and send me a letter that if i don't respond back they will treat it as confirmed debt and will make me liable. I called them and nobody picked up and i left them 2 to 3 times voicemail that please send everything in writing do not call as I am practicing the Fairness act of Debt collections. 
Anyway i send them a detailed letter as followed below in text. 

Bilateral Credit Collection XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, RI XXXX XXXX : Account No : XXXX To Whom It May Concern I do not consent to this debt and I totally dispute the validity of the debt in the above-reference account number # XXXX and would like verification from you of the obligation, the amount owed, and proof of a detailed valid assignment of the debt from the original creditor to you. I request everything to be send in written format and no phone calls or text messages. Please send me copies of all documents related to this dispute including along with the following questions answered. 
Q1 : Who you are you? Who do you represent? provide me a detailed contract copy if you are representing the original Creditor? Provide the facts and proof that you are the original representation?

Q2 : What is your direct number and what is the actual company headquarter address?

Q3 : What is your professional license information? Also are you registered in Washington state to send the dispute details as per law? As you are based out of state most probably you have to take retain local counsel?

Q4 : What was your process of getting the debt from the original creditor? what detailed information you asked or obtained? What was your verification process if it was actually a debt or a dispute? if you did not comply with the law to gather proper evidence of the claim disputes, you are already violating the law time.

Q 5 : Before sending the verification of the dispute, did you really investigated on your side what was the core issue why this all happened? 
Q 4 : Provide all the documents account records, invoices of claims and correspondence on what specific date?

Q5 : How you come up with this {$18000.00} amount and what is the breakdown of these charges?

Q6 : Based on my knowledge, Debt collectors signed a contract with the original creditor either on a commission basis or buy the debt for pretty cheap amount? By law and fairness Debt Collection Practices Act, you are supposed to provide all that information? How much was the actual amount you bought the debt or dispute for? Is there any documentation/ contract between you and the original creditor. 
Q7 : How can you seek verification and validation of the debt?

I am also exercising my rights under the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, 15 U.S.C 1692, and demand that you cease all communication except with me, my family members and all other third persons. Also you have violated the law of Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, by calling multiple times on different dates to pressurize and threaten about the debt when I left a voice message and left a message to one of your agent not to call on my number. Please send me all things in written. 
You are here by notifies that if you do not comply with this request, I will immediately file a complaint with the Federal Trade Commission and to the State Attorney General 's Office. If you are not able to provide the answer to the above questions and proper researched verification of the dispute within 15 to 30 days of time then you are violating the FDCPA detailed Civil and criminal claims will be pursued.

I can not pay this debt as I do not consent and I do not validate this debt to be considered as a debt. I am already going through financial hardship, medical issues myself and for my family, and on top of this bilateral Credit collection continues calls and violated the law when even told not to call back that have put more pressure and created more stress environment for myself. 
Sincerely, XXXX XXXX They still called me and last time threaten me to take action against me and report my credit collection right away which they did not. About 2 to 3 weeks passed, then now i have received one more letter from them to call them urgently to resolve as they tried to resolve this case. First of all, I disputed and they failed to provide me with the proof and validity and their connection with the original creditor. They threaten me also voilated by calling me multiple times then it stopped but last time they called when i clearly mentioned al communication in written as my right. Then they started bashing out and said you are this and threaten to take action. funny thing is that there employees can not take control of this small small tasks, how come a company owner saying i am the owner and i do all the work lol it is funny to me, that means the workers are stupid and not capable of handling an danswering and resolving and seeing the case. Why the owner of the company will do basic paper work job and call like a customer service that is strange to me. They also have mishandling and putting false claims on other people and there are reports on betterbusiness burea. Anyway i have my proof of recording of leaving them message to just send everything in written and they still voilated it. Also I have the recording of the person who said I am the owner and i will report it right away and shut the phone and was not even listening.They need to know they have to pay for the compensation and my waste of time if they plan to drag it further. Also they need to stop this immediately otherwise I will report them.",,"Bilateral Credit Corp, LLC",WA,980XX,,Consent provided,Web,20/09/2019,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,3379164

"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports",Credit reporting,Incorrect information on your report,Information belongs to someone else,"Accounts added and/or created unbeknownst to me Notice to whom it be of concern,It is YOU I hold accountable and accuse of complicity in exercise of malevolent did-compliance. I hereby mark you as likely one that I might one day view in civil discord as the ""would be plaintiffs"", yet I declare to you your unjust claim is to be met with deliberate and determined resistance and counteraction. In is in clarity that your Claim of Non-Medical debt Collection is insufficient for collections much less reporting. You MUST DELETE this unjust injurious allegation because it is significantly deficient of the requisite certified reporting compliance (such as perfect metro 2 format reporting) and testimonial evidence of the PHYSICALLY VERIFIABLE PROOF OF VALIDATION as related to the full truth, accuracy, completeness, timeliness, ownership, identity of true debtor, dates ,balances, audits, calculations, source codes, creditor collection code, 426-chrc P6 statement and its associated trailing fragments, the minimal five portioned personal identifiers, the pay statuses , the required 386-pieces of confirmation to collection, and elsewise standard or mandatory for proper reporting, mentioned or not. Although I am checking for and addressing missing and or deficient aspects of REPORTING COMPLIANCES and not contesting any debt of compliant nature, I should make you aware that since unlawful reporting transitions collection into an equally not complaint circumstance. Being still yet not validated by document fact in compliance to requisite standards, it is to be announced yet again that legally I have no knowledge of the validity of the alleged claims of delinquency and or derogatory nature, nor of the certifiably compliant matter to either any of it’s collection attempts and or it’s reporting despite previous consumer filed composed complaints checking for each. Might it be known, especially shall I elect to take this matter up to a civil court, any debt and or derogatory claim must be pursued (particularly for collection) in a very defined and precisely compliant and physically verifiable or certifiable manner as detailed in the requisite obeyed federal and state collection and reporting regulations associated with any of the above noted said claim(s) to include but not limited to the FCBA, FCRA,HIPAA PRIVACY RULE, FACTA,FDCPA and TCPA, etc. ADDITIONALLY, if an entity acts as a collector and also elects to act as a reporting party of consumer credit they must as well adhere to every single one even each any and all of the regulatory reporting requisites and standards of reporting with legal standing in full accordance of laws and accepted reporting standards. To date, the plaintiff has failed to demonstrate any capacity or willingness to validate the alleged debt much less certify the fair, accurate, complete and compliant reporting of the claims, particularly being significantly deficient is any display of certified metro 2 compliance. As such, given the fact of recent breaches of information collection repositories, I am hesitating to readily accept what is presented without testimonial and certified physically verifiable document evidence of claim as being legitimate. I deny nothing, yet I reserve the right to question any unproven claim. I do NOT accept the statement of claim of the plaintiff and I call for the court to reject their claim as untrue, unverified, incomplete, not compliant or otherwise invalid and thereby reject-able and dischargeable which requirement to be dismissed in full. I demand said court resolution today, even here and now in full accords of regulatory statutes, mentioned by me or not.1) To date, I have received no knowledge of ever entering into any contractual relationship with the to-be plaintiff(s) {should I forward into a civil complaint} or with the entity(ies) that allegedly issued against me the defaulted line of credit(s) or accusations similar. This despite repeated calls to the accusers to demonstrate the requisite presented physically verifiable document proof of adequately acquired permissible purpose from the exactly and only individual irrefutably identified as being me. I have no acknowledgement of a relationship with the parties mentioned, in any form. 2) I have no knowledge of ever knowingly acknowledging (or even unknowingly doing so) that I owe any proven and compliantly reported debt, much less the claim of unproven debt alleged in this written declaration CHECKING for not only VALIDITY of CLAIMS but also DOCUMENT PROOF IN CERTIFIABLE TESTIMONY as to the factual and complete COMPLIANCE to all standards and laws, even the mandatory Metro 2 Format Compliance. Its obvious that the allegations filed by the accusers (or to-be plaintiff) are in clear subterfuge of act, be it in willful disregard of ethical practices or be it done so in ignorance of requisite ethical and regulatory compliant behavior during their accusations, collection efforts and credit reporting of claims. The vile nature of their derelict is unjustly injurious and unlawful no doubt. I again call for a dismissal of to-be plaintiff’s statement of claim(s) and discharge of misreported delinquencies and derogatory behavior that the accuser’s complaint is undeniably unfairly lodged versus me. 3) I have no knowledge of ever receiving any proven or document facts in statement of account or account aspects for these items of alleged debt and delinquent actions. Again, I reiterate I have called on the accusers to present to be document certifiably true, correct, complete, and adequately compliant documentation in full validation of claims, rights to collect alleged claims, and rights to report alleged claims. Let it be true that COMPLIANCE of regulatory requisites is MANDATORY not OPTIONAL. Plaintiff’s claims are mute of legal standing in full accordance of law and must be dismissed.4) I have no knowledge of ever entering into an open account with to-be Plaintiff(s) or with the entity(ies) that allegedly issued me the defaulted line of credit(s) or derogatory claims of credit.5) FACT IS, no claim above has even submitted adequate compliant proof of the genesis of any consumer/creditor relationship and their inability to prove application, permissible purpose for said alleged application, consumer/creditor agreement in contract describing a relationship related to alleged claim of account and or debt(s), and or otherwise derelict documentation of claim(s) inherently makes invalid the to-be Plaintiff’s whole statement of claim in this summons or complaint. I request court to resolve adequately and compliantly as required with the immediate eradication of complaint charge(s) and rectification of any injurious collection or reporting practices. Again, COMPLIANCE of APPROPRIATE COLLECTION PRACTICES and equally COMPLIANCE of APPROPRIATE and COMPLETE REPORTING PRACTICES is MANDATORY, NOT OPTIONAL. 6) As it stands, until PROVEN OTHERWISE, the complaining to-be Plaintiff(s) does so unjustly, unethically ,and likely illegally so in absolute deficiency of requisite legal standing in full accordance of applicable laws ( mentioned or not),both to collection practices and as well with reporting practices, particularly in the inability or unwillingness to timely and fully certify physically verifiable document proof in full validity of debt claim or compliance of reporting, even to the mandatory Metro 2 format. As such, here again I declare my right and preference to stand against all claims of the to-be Plaintiff(s) and call on your authority and INTEGRITY to ensure truth of claim, correctness of claim, completeness of claim, ownership and responsibility of any debt(s) or delinquencies of debt alleged in above noted claim(s), perfect and prove-able compliance of collection actions related to claim(s), and compliance of reporting actions related to claim(s)....................",,"EQUIFAX, INC.",FL,330XX,,Consent provided,Web,10/12/2019,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,3464108

XXXX XXXX advised me that the account listed on the notice was not a valid account with them. I had XXXX XXXX also check my social to see if there were any old accounts for me, which there are/were none. I spoke to several people within XXXX XXXX 's idenitity theft and fraud units. 
I called ARA, Inc at XXXX the next day and inititally spoke to XXXX XXXX. I explained that I believed they had some bad info on me as XXXX XXXX had no record of this debt.

XXXX XXXX placed me on a brief hold to 'verify this info ', and another woman XXXX XXXX picked up. I explained all of this to XXXX XXXX like I did to XXXX and XXXX XXXX told me that the original creditor was really XXXX Bank and that the credit card was mailed in XXXX to an old residence that I did not live at in XXXX. She said that the inflated debt was due to late fees, interest, and penalties, and she stated my SS # to me and that the debt was valid and then started yelling at me. She yelled at me that they would sue me in XXXX XXXX which I lived and then hung up on me. 
I spoke to the Fraud Unit at XXXX XXXX who put me in contact with XXXX to show that some Fraud activity on my credit may appear. I made a report with XXXX and I filed a complaint with the CFPB, my next step will be to contact my XXXX and the XXXX.

I got the loan thru BBVA. I set up online automatic withdrawal. I had problems setting it up online. So I tried over the phone. I was told I had everything set up online and all accounts, charges, settings were set. 
Well, after the first month, I started getting late notices on payments in XXXX 2018. I called and doubled checked my online account. Everything looked normal and already set up. On the phone, the representative would go over my account and said all was fine, it must be a glitch. And submit a work ticket. I never heard anything back.

Then 2-3 weeks later, I would get more mail stating I was failing to make regular monthly payments on my loan to BBVA. 
I once again, called and talked to a representative over the phone. Same thing. They said it was taken care of. 
In XX/XX/2018, I finally went into a local BBVA bank and said I wanted to speak to someone in charge and find out why my payments were not being submitted and why the auto withdrawal was not going thru. After 5 days, it was finally straightened out. BBVA apparently had the wrong account number from my bank. I had submitted it correctly, but they kept entering one too many digits. 
However, it is because of 2-3 months of NONE payments, I believe my credit history has suffered. I have a score of XXXX, as of XXXX-18. I believe this to be unfair since it was not my error back in XX/XX/2018, when BBVA made the mistake on my loan account. I wish for this to be corrected, reviewed and addressed. Since the correction, I have been late on NO accounts and fully pay all loans and bills on time with no past due or collection agencies.",,BBVA FINANCIAL CORPORATION,CO,804XX,,Consent provided,Web,10/12/2018,Closed with non-monetary relief,Yes,N/A,3096980

Credit card,,Other,,"I was stupid enough to charge some items at MACY 'S on my Macy 's credit card over XXXX. I was unable to log into my account online to make the payment because Macy 's had updated the system and I simply did n't have the patience to navigate their irritating and obscure system. However, I called Macy 's and paid my bill for $ XXXX a day or two late - was assured that there would be no late charges because I was a customer in good standing, yada yada, and received a confirmation number that I had paid the bill in full. 

I then received a bill for {$2.00} in interest. OK, I agree - I had n't paid the {$140.00} on time, regardless of the reason. Whatever. So I paid that {$2.00} bill immediately, by check, and left the country for an extended absence - in complete confidence that I had paid all my bills in full. 

Imagine my surprise when I returned to the US and found that Macy 's had received and cashed my check, but charged me a further {$2.00} anyway as a minimum interest charge on the interest charge that had been paid in full, well before the due date. Oh, and then added a further minimum {$2.00} charge for a total of {$4.00}, due on XXXX. 

I called Macy 's right away and spoke to one XXXX, who did n't seem to have a clue why I was irritated, but eventually - very grudgingly and with full implication that I was a total deadbeat - agreed that she would "" waive '' the {$4.00}. 

Imagine my FURTHER surprise when I received a FURTHER email from Macy 's about my "" account balance. '' I immediately called, went through endless voice prompts, and finally got through to a live human being who said in hushed tones that she 'd have to put me through to another department. 

Sure enough, I got the "" this is an attempt to collect a debt '' speech. The glorious XXXX, according to the faultlessly polite CS rep who answered, had failed to properly credit my account. He agreed that he could correct it and that my account would update eventually to show a {$0.00} balance. However, he was unable to reassure me that this, um, "" delinquency '' had not been reported to the credit bureaux that make a darn good living off selling my info, and he could not send me a letter saying that Macy 's had made a mistake. Given that the glorious XXXX had also assured me that I had a {$0.00} balance on my Macy 's charge card, forgive me if I 'm not confident that I do in fact now have a {$0.00} balance. 

I do not give a flying whatever about my credit as I am old and cranky and do n't need any credit. I DO care that Macy 's total incompetence and the Macy 's system that is set up to fail, to their benefit and to consumers ' detriment, affects kids and other people who DO need good credit.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,"CITIBANK, N.A.",NC,286XX,,Consent provided,Web,13/04/2017,Closed with monetary relief,Yes,No,2432795

I have no business dealings with this company and have never spoke with anyone, form this company. As for the original creditor ( XXXX XXXX ) I am not a member of their gym, I have never joined, the gym and there is no documentation or signed agreement, between my self and the company. This is not my account and it is showing on my credit account, wrongfully and illegally. XXXX ( Collection agency ) Has never contacted me regarding, this account and I have never done any business with this company. The original creditor is XXXX XXXX XXXX and I did visit the office. But, I did have insurance coverage. If there was a co pay due or any additional monies due, that wasn't covered by my insurance, I should have been given a bill, at the time of visit or at the very least, mailed out to me. I have never received any contact or bills forward to me. Therefore I had no knowledge of any outstanding monies. In addition, my insurance company, didn't notify me of me having a co pay of a portion of the bill that had to be covered my me. Therefore this debt is a error and if the debt is my portion of the bill, why wasn't I billed, so that the matter could be taken care of, in a timely fashion. There are guidelines in place, that require a notification period, before the medical debt can be place on the credit report. This was completely overlooked and not followed, as I have never received any notification, via phone, text, email or U.S. Postal service.

Mortgage,Conventional home mortgage,Closing on a mortgage,,"I started a loan with with Ethos Lending ( XXXX XXXX, Ca ) on XX/XX/18 and had given them all of the information they requested and my credit scores were excellent that they used from a credit report done XXXX. Then two days before my signing date on XX/XX/XXXX, ( on XX/XX/XXXX ) they told me I would be charged a 1.099 % fee because my credit scores had dropped ( three credit agencies ) from XXXX to XXXX. I told them it was a mistake and when I called the credit agencies they told me it was because of a XXXX $ XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX bill that was unpaid. So I called XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX and found out it was not my primary bill, but a secondary bill from another property and they had sent it to the wrong address, not my current address they send my other bills. XXXX XXXXXXXX sent a letter out ( which they never do ) to all three credit agencies to negate this late report. Within 15 days my credit scores all rose 80 points to back over 740.  Well I signed the paperwork in the mean time and when I went back to Ethos they said they wouldn't rebate me the fees.. 
First I think when they first ran my report to see the excellent scores and approved my loan they shouldn't be able to change that and charge me {$4900.00} two days before I sign the paperwork, just to hit me up with another charge. 
And secondly when I show they the low ratings were wrong ( shown by the letter from XXXX saying to delete this report to all three credit agencies ) and then two weeks later all three scores rose to their normally high scores they should refund me the {$4900.00} charge because the ratings were false reports ... .. 
Ethos said they would explore this but just said well tough..",,ETHOS LENDING LLC,CA,93021,Older American,Consent provided,Web,4/11/2018,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,3064962

I entered XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX in XXXX FL. Prior to this i looked at inventory online and saw what I wanted and didn't want anything else but this XXXX XXXX XXXX sports bike. I sat with one of the sales guys and he told me I was approved and that my loan would be for 2 years. I was so excited about this I was not even thinking, i was signing away paperwork. The bike in the dealer was in the amount of {$5900.00} with dealer fee and tag title, came out to XXXX. I gave a down payment of XXXX. I have had my bike for 2 years and I am still making payments on this bike. I asked the place Cycleone Financial,  where i send my payments when i look at my documents they had me sign a Lease document on a used bike that had 32,000 miles on it, on the paperwork it states it had 18,500 and that is wrong. When i am finish paying this bike it would total {$14000.00}. If i would have known this i would have not bothered to take the bike. This bike since i took it out the dealers lot has given me problems, non stop. I asked and i was not able to even trade my bike in for another bike, i wanted to because the bike was giving me to much problems, i was denied that opportunity for a trade in. I was blind sided due to my excitement, this bike is not worth XXXX, not even with interest rate would this had come out to that much. My bike has been to a shop over 6 times in 2 and half years. I take very good care of it, its a passion I have but all these issue is uncalled for. When i first took it out all the lights were coming off, I had to use my warranty for a starter the 1st year. Thinking it was leased when I found out you would think they would let you get into something else especially when they automatically put you on a lease without you knowing. the paperwork from the dealer itself has my sisters social.

"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports",Credit reporting,Incorrect information on your report,Account information incorrect,"Good Morning, Im submitting this complaint against XXXX XXXX XXXX, because they reported 30 day late payments to the three credit bureaus on my vehicle loan. 
The vehicle loan account is in me and my husbands name ; On XX/XX/XXXX, my husband went to apply for an apartment and was denied due to all the late payments that where on his credit report. According to the apartment complex, the late payments showed up on Transuion, XXXX, and  XXXX. These are the late payments that are currently on our credit report ; XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX. 

On XX/XX/XXXX at XXXX XXXX, I contacted XXXX to get clarification on these late payments, because according to my documents I was never 30 days late. The first person I spoke with a XXXX   over the phone was XXXX and I inquired about all the late payments that were reported to the three credit bureaus. XXXX stated, I only see that XX/XX/XXXX, has been reported to the credit bureaus. Thats when I chimed in and said, According to the credit report that the apartment complex pulled on my husband, XXXX reported these months as being 30 days late ( XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, and XX/XX/XXXX ). 
XXXX stated that she has limited ability to see whats on my vehicle loan account far as payments are concerned. I asked her to transfer me to a supervisor, and she stated should would be it will be a while before the supervisor would be on the call. I waited 30 mins before XXXX the collections supervisor go on the line. He introduced himself as XXXX the collections supervisor. I asked XXXX, could he tell me what late payments did XXXX report to the 3 credit bureaus because my husband had his credit report pulled by the apartment complex and was denied the apartment because of several late payments on his credit report, I explained to him me and my husband are both on the car loan. XXXX stated, I have limited visablity to you car loan account. I said, You are a supervisor and you cant tell me what 30 day late payments XXXX submitted to the credit bureaus. XXXX said, We report differently to the credit bureaus, for instance if it the XXXX and we havent received a payment by then we report you to the credit bureaus. I informed him that was illegal because by law you must be 30 days late on payments before you can submit it to the 3 credit bureaus. XXXX is giving me this illegal information on a recorded XXXX line. He instructed me to send a letter to the XXXX direct dispute department. After he gave me that information, I informed him that I would be submitting a complaint with the CFPB about these late payments and this wasnt the first time that XXXX  sent incorrect info to the credit bureaus on this car loan. 
Please remove inaccurate late payments for these months from the 3 credit bureaus ; XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX. Also is there a way from preventing the month of XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX from being submitted to these three credit bureaus Transuion, XXXX and XXXX.

A payment they clearly received in time to make an earlier payoff, since they returned that original check to me.

Our loan was transferred in good standing and was a simple transfer. 

Our loan has never been late and since transfer to XXXX XXXX, and due to their poor reputation as a debt collector, I have paid my mortgage early every month and in excess of the balance due. 

SPS has reported false and damaging loan terms which I was unable to fix through normal CRA disputes. In violation of the FCRA, SPS has reported our loan to all 3 Credit Bureaus with false remarks : LOAN MODIFIED NonGovt, Loan Modified and including purchase money first. When I disputed this false reporting, it was verified by SPS as accurate. 

My mortgage was sold by XXXX XXXX XXXX. and this loan was not a requested transfer. Furthermore, I contend that because we have nearly perfect credit scores of 820+ FICO 9, SPS Servicing reported false terms to lower our credit and attempt to retain us as a long term client by lowering our score. 

The reporting of Loan Modified on a credit obligation is considered a derogatory indicator by FICO Score 9 ( and within the auto and bankcard versions of FICO Score 9 ) and would trigger the negative score factor You have a serious delinquency ( 60 days past due or greater ) or derogatory indicator on your credit report. to surface. This particular narrative ( Loan Modified ) first became available in the XXXX data when FICO Score 9 was developed.

Due to this false comment, SPS has negatively impacted our XXXX FICO Score 9 causing a drop of 100 points for XXXX XXXX and 69 points for XXXX XXXX. Our previous FICO 9 scores were XXXX and XXXX on XX/XX/18. Now they are XXXX and XXXX respectively.

Moreover, per the attachment to this complaint Experian has stated that since I have "" previously disputed this item. We are not required to process a duplicative dispute.

"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports",Credit reporting,Incorrect information on your report,Information belongs to someone else,"Accounts added and/or created unbeknownst to me Notice to whom it be of concern, It is YOU I hold accountable and accuse of complicity in exercise of malevolent did-compliance. I hereby mark you as likely one that I might one day view in civil discord as the "" would be plaintiffs '', yet I declare to you your unjust claim is to be met with deliberate and determined resistance and counteraction. In is in clarity that your Claim of Non-Medical debt Collection is insufficient for collections much less reporting. You MUST DELETE this unjust injurious allegation because it is significantly deficient of the requisite certified reporting compliance ( such as perfect metro 2 format reporting ) and testimonial evidence of the PHYSICALLY VERIFIABLE PROOF OF VALIDATION as related to the full truth, accuracy, completeness, timeliness, ownership, identity of true debtor, dates, balances, audits, calculations, source codes, creditor collection code, 426-chrc P6 statement and its associated trailing fragments, the minimal five portioned personal identifiers, the pay statuses, the required 386-pieces of confirmation to collection, and elsewise standard or mandatory for proper reporting, mentioned or not.

Although I am checking for and addressing missing and or deficient aspects of REPORTING COMPLIANCES and not contesting any debt of compliant nature, I should make you aware that since unlawful reporting transitions collection into an equally not complaint circumstance. Being still yet not validated by document fact in compliance to requisite standards, it is to be announced yet again that legally I have no knowledge of the validity of the alleged claims of delinquency and or derogatory nature, nor of the certifiably compliant matter to either any of its collection attempts and or its reporting despite previous consumer filed composed complaints checking for each. Might it be known, especially shall I elect to take this matter up to a civil court, any debt and or derogatory claim must be pursued ( particularly for collection ) in a very defined and precisely compliant and physically verifiable or certifiable manner as detailed in the requisite obeyed federal and state collection and reporting regulations associated with any of the above noted said claim ( s ) to include but not limited to the FCBA, FCRA, HIPAA PRIVACY RULE, FACTA, FDCPA and TCPA, etc. ADDITIONALLY, if an entity acts as a collector and also elects to act as a reporting party of consumer credit they must as well adhere to every single one even each any and all of the regulatory reporting requisites and standards of reporting with legal standing in full accordance of laws and accepted reporting standards. To date, the plaintiff has failed to demonstrate any capacity or willingness to validate the alleged debt much less certify the fair, accurate, complete and compliant reporting of the claims, particularly being significantly deficient is any display of certified metro 2 compliance. As such, given the fact of recent breaches of information collection repositories, I am hesitating to readily accept what is presented without testimonial and certified physically verifiable document evidence of claim as being legitimate. I deny nothing, yet I reserve the right to question any unproven claim. I do NOT accept the statement of claim of the plaintiff and I call for the court to reject their claim as untrue, unverified, incomplete, not compliant or otherwise invalid and thereby reject-able and dischargeable which requirement to be dismissed in full. I demand said court resolution today, even here and now in full accords of regulatory statutes, mentioned by me or not.

1 ) To date, I have received no knowledge of ever entering into any contractual relationship with the to-be plaintiff ( s ) { should I forward into a civil complaint } or with the entity ( ies ) that allegedly issued against me the defaulted line of credit ( s ) or accusations similar. This despite repeated calls to the accusers to demonstrate the requisite presented physically verifiable document proof of adequately acquired permissible purpose from the exactly and only individual irrefutably identified as being me. I have no acknowledgement of a relationship with the parties mentioned, in any form.

2 ) I have no knowledge of ever knowingly acknowledging ( or even unknowingly doing so ) that I owe any proven and compliantly reported debt, much less the claim of unproven debt alleged in this written declaration CHECKING for not only VALIDITY of CLAIMS but also DOCUMENT PROOF IN CERTIFIABLE TESTIMONY as to the factual and complete COMPLIANCE to all standards and laws, even the mandatory Metro 2 Format Compliance. Its obvious that the allegations filed by the accusers ( or to-be plaintiff ) are in clear subterfuge of act, be it in willful disregard of ethical practices or be it done so in ignorance of requisite ethical and regulatory compliant behavior during their accusations, collection efforts and credit reporting of claims. The vile nature of their derelict is unjustly injurious and unlawful no doubt. I again call for a dismissal of to-be plaintiffs statement of claim ( s ) and discharge of misreported delinquencies and derogatory behavior that the accusers complaint is undeniably unfairly lodged versus me.

3 ) I have no knowledge of ever receiving any proven or document facts in statement of account or account aspects for these items of alleged debt and delinquent actions. Again, I reiterate I have called on the accusers to present to be document certifiably true, correct, complete, and adequately compliant documentation in full validation of claims, rights to collect alleged claims, and rights to report alleged claims. Let it be true that COMPLIANCE of regulatory requisites is MANDATORY not OPTIONAL. Plaintiffs claims are mute of legal standing in full accordance of law and must be dismissed.

4 ) I have no knowledge of ever entering into an open account with to-be Plaintiff ( s ) or with the entity ( ies ) that allegedly issued me the defaulted line of credit ( s ) or derogatory claims of credit.

5 ) FACT IS, no claim above has even submitted adequate compliant proof of the genesis of any consumer/creditor relationship and their inability to prove application, permissible purpose for said alleged application, consumer/creditor agreement in contract describing a relationship related to alleged claim of account and or debt ( s ), and or otherwise derelict documentation of claim ( s ) inherently makes invalid the to-be Plaintiffs whole statement of claim in this summons or complaint. I request court to resolve adequately and compliantly as required with the immediate eradication of complaint charge ( s ) and rectification of any injurious collection or reporting practices. Again, COMPLIANCE of APPROPRIATE COLLECTION PRACTICES and equally COMPLIANCE of APPROPRIATE and COMPLETE REPORTING PRACTICES is MANDATORY, NOT OPTIONAL.

6 ) As it stands, until PROVEN OTHERWISE, the complaining to-be Plaintiff ( s ) does so unjustly, unethically, and likely illegally so in absolute deficiency of requisite legal standing in full accordance of applicable laws ( mentioned or not ), both to collection practices and as well with reporting practices, particularly in the inability or unwillingness to timely and fully certify physically verifiable document proof in full validity of debt claim or compliance of reporting, even to the mandatory Metro 2 format. As such, here again I declare my right and preference to stand against all claims of the to-be Plaintiff ( s ) and call on your authority and INTEGRITY to ensure truth of claim, correctness of claim, completeness of claim, ownership and responsibility of any debt ( s ) or delinquencies of debt alleged in above noted claim ( s ), perfect and prove-able compliance of collection actions related to claim ( s ), and compliance of reporting actions related to claim ( s ) ... ... ... ... ... ... ..",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,"TRANSUNION INTERMEDIATE HOLDINGS, INC.",NY,107XX,,Consent provided,Web,10/10/2019,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,3401646

I looked at my credit report in the last year and saw that this account was still open, so then I launched an investigation via my credit bureau to look into why this account was open, but did not get an answer. This really caught my attention when my tax refund was taken by this company.

Checking or savings account,Checking account,Managing an account,Banking errors,"I responded to HSBC 's promotion and opened an HSBC Advance Checking account in XXXX of 2019. Received an email that they processed my opening deposit on XX/XX/19. The promo stated that I had to keep the funds in for 90 days. Then, HSBC would take "" up to an additional 8 weeks '' to deposit the {$350.00} bonus amount. So, the timeline would take us to end of XXXX 2019. I called and emailed in XXXX. Nothing happened. I called an additional 3 times and emailed in XXXX and XXXX. The bonus should've been deposited by XX/XX/19!! I spoke to several people including supervisors. The names are XXXX, XXXX ( supervisor ), XXXX ( supervisor ) and today on XX/XX/19 XXXX. All emails responses and all phone calls ( which lasted about 45 min. each ) rendered absolutely no resolution OR timing. In fact ( and these calls should all be recorded and verifiable ). I was told that the Marketing Dept. was responsible for the Bonus but they were not allowed to contact them nor was a customer. Here I sit as a very frustrated and psychologically abused customer with no idea when or if my funds will be available. It's been an additional 6 weeks on top of the 90 days + 8 weeks. Each of the email responses I received within my HSBC account website states that their "" Management Team '' is working on it and needs more time. MORE TIME? This is a simple digital and electronic transaction. What is their "" Management Team '' actually working on. Really! Were they "" all '' hit by a bus. This offer was completely misrepresented and fraudulent. They seem to keep the customer in a black hole while they maximize their float income and take advantage of their customer. Unable to contact anyone at the organization with any authority to resolve this AND THEY stated that there is no one else I can contact. It's now about 6+ months waiting while I earn about .01 % which I did not see in any fine print! Is this blatant manipulation of the customer so HSBC can squeeze every last penny by delaying any contractually required payment. Total misrepresentation and pathetic customer service which HSBC claims in World Class!  How do any of the regulators let them get away with any of this.

"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports",Credit reporting,Incorrect information on your report,Account information incorrect,"XX/XX/XXXX I received a letter from chase stating that they are reporting my Home Equity Line of Credit ( HELOC ) as charged off on XX/XX/XXXX with unpaid balance of {$24000.00}.

They stated they canceled the balance owed on XX/XX/XXXX and issued a XXXX. and as a result updated charge off balance to {$0.00} on XX/XX/XXXX and reported to credit bureaus on XX/XX/XXXX.

Further they state they carefully reviewed the account and did not find any misrepresentations, unfair tactics or tried to be deceiving.

And that they are required to report accurately.

The problem with these statements are my credit report shows a charge off in the payment history on XX/XX/XXXX. Then the next data entry shows a charge off on XX/XX/XXXX.

The status shows a balance update and status of charge off update to be XX/XX/XXXX when they clearly said in the letter the balance was canceled on XX/XX/XXXX. If the balance is {$0.00} on XX/XX/XXXX it should state XX/XX/XXXX not XX/XX/XXXX.

The next problem is the XXXX they furnished in the letter and sent to the irs shows an identifiable event code of ( F ) By Agreement. This would have to mean that I made an agreement with them to cancel the debt owed for less than the full balance. This would be false.

The date of the Identifiable event is XX/XX/XXXX. Considering the Irs regulations prior to XX/XX/XXXX. If a debt has not been paid for 36 months and active collection is not pursued then a XXXX is to be issued even if the debt is not discharged. The account was delinquent prior to XX/XX/XXXX and closed and charged off XX/XX/XXXX. A XXXX should have been issued prior to XX/XX/XXXX. So in this case the XXXX was issued in the wrong year with incorrect event coding Finally according to XXXX  county land records there was a mortgage assignment filed for this account. The Assignment of mortgage was not to Chase Home Finance nor Chase Home Lending. Which gives reason to believe the incorrect creditor is reporting the debt and that they do not have a valid claim. Whether the Assignment of mortgage is valid is speculative considering the notary had been suspended and the agent on behalf of Chase may or may not have worked for Chase.

My actions have been contacting Chase about the misrepresentations and they have stated the account has been charged off since XX/XX/XXXXbut it is still open and they are reporting correctly.

I disputed with Credit Reporting Agencies to validate the information which is clearly incorrect. The came back that they only report what they are told to and that it was validated.

I have submitted a prior complaint to CFPB which contacted Chase which responded with the letter that I have explained.

I have continually ran into problems getting credit due to this account reporting the charge off as XX/XX/XXXX since Derogatory Credit waiting periods require 4 years though the Charge Off had occurred XX/XX/XXXX. The cancellation of debt was XX/XX/XXXX which is not a charge off especially if the account was already charged off.",,JPMORGAN CHASE & CO.,IL,601XX,Servicemember,Consent provided,Web,16/01/2019,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,3126827

"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports",Credit reporting,Problem with a credit reporting company's investigation into an existing problem,Their investigation did not fix an error on your report,"During several dates, I have sent certified mail to the credit bureaus asking them to verify the inaccuracies of the information on the bankruptcy they are reporting. On my report, it lists the liabilities and assets being {$0.00}. This is not accurate and you can see this highlighted on the report attached. On several dates, I received the response from the bureau stating they verified the information. I then sent a letter to the XXXX County Court Clerk 's office asking if they verified the information to the bureaus. They sent me a letter stating that they do not provide information to the bureaus. The XXXX creditor was sent a letter for verification and validation and they have not responded to my request and have exceeded the mandatory 30 day time limit. XXXX XXXX was also contacted and has not sent verification.

My complaint is this, I challenged the Items based upon the inaccurate reporting of the {$0.00} assets and {$0.00} Liabilities on my report for the BK. Pertaining to the XXXX account, they have not responded to certified mail and confirmed verification and validation of their inaccurate reporting. The XXXX XXXX account jumps instantly into 60 day late reporting mark but does not say a 30 day period was breached. I have also added proof that these bureaus are not doing a true verification and supplying relevant proof while not flippantly dismissing the FCRA mandated rules. The bureaus also refuse to provide and form of evidence there for proving their verification. The Bureaus claimed that they had verified the information, when clearly they could not have for two reasons for the BK, 1 ) it is impossible to have a bankruptcy and have {$0.00} liabilities and {$0.00} assets reported 2 ) the bureaus claimed they verified the information, yet the source of the information sent me a letter that they do not verify information with the courts. Also, I put a Freeze on my XXXX XXXX report yet they used that agency ( NO third party can verify per FCRA ) as a third party.

This leads me to conclude that the credit bureaus never conducted a reasonable investigation on this inaccurate information for the BK. For the XXXX account they have not responded to my request for validation and verification and time has lapsed past 30 days.

In my certified mail I also requested they remove any inquiries that are not currently associated to any account. The credit bureaus also said they verified the information but can't provide any proof. If they do have proof they have not provided that to me after many requests.

I would like to have this inaccurate records removed from my credit report as it is reporting inaccurately and incomplete on my report.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,Experian Information Solutions Inc.,TX,761XX,,Consent provided,Web,7/01/2019,Closed with non-monetary relief,Yes,N/A,3118512

I called the company right away and made them aware of the fraud and they refused to listen to me or do anything about it. I asked them to send me proof that it was my debt and they would not. Instead they informed me that they turned the accounts over to a third party collection agency and that they would not discuss them with me and that I needed to call them. I immediately called this third party agency and told them that this debt was not mine and they continuously told me that it was. I began to even break out in tears and demanded how unfair this was and to take the items off of my report immediately. I asked them to send me proof that it was my debt and they said it would take 5-7 business days to get the documents to me via e-mail. After a week I called them back and this time I asked for the manager and him how concerned, upset, and unfair I felt about this debt being on my credit and them still not giving me any type of proof of it or having any urgency to do so.

"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports",Credit reporting,Incorrect information on your report,Account status incorrect,"In XXXX, I called XXXX XXXX to request a refund of a fee they were charging me that I had previously requested NOT be put on my mortgage statement as I had been in contract to sell me house since XXXX and the closing was scheduled for XX/XX/2018. Unbeknownst to me, the representative I had spoken to reversed my entire XXXX mortgage payment instead of just crediting me the {$7.00} that was erroneously taken out of my checking account. Upon attending our closing, and our title closer speaking with the representative from XXXX XXXX and receiving the closing figures, we successfully concluded our closing thinking everything was fine. A month later I received a notice from XXXX XXXX advising we were in arrears in our mortgage payment. I immediately contacted XXXX XXXX explaining that we had closed that account on XX/XX/18. They advised that they indeed saw the money for the pay-off of the mortgage however it was being held in a suspense account pending further investigation. I told them to expeditiously examine the issue and get back to me asap. After not hearing from them for over a week, I called the servicing center and spoke to an agent that informed me I owed them {$2000.00} for XXXX mortgage payment. I said that was incorrect as I was enrolled in EFT which automatically pays my mortgage. I was then apprised with the fact that XXXX XXXX had reversed the entire mortgage payment for XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX instead of crediting me the {$7.00} I had requested. I told them at no time was I EVER made aware that the entire XXXX payment was being reversed as I would not have allowed that to happen. They told me they would "" look into this ''. I also advised them that THEIR AGENT gave the figures at the closing on XX/XX/XXXX which indicated that XXXX XXXX knew the payment was reversed and should have included that in the closing numbers. I then went back and forth with XXXX XXXX for several weeks regarding this disaster speaking with agent after agent and vehemently demanded that no action be taken with any credit agency until AFTER a full investigation of the issue was resolved as this was surely the fault of XXXX XXXX. I was assured by a supervisor at XXXX XXXX that indeed no action would be taken. In XXXX, I was notified by the credit agencies that our credit score had dropped over 200 points due to late payments on our mortgage! I again contacted XXXX XXXX demanding they reverse this negative report only to be told they can not. I am sure you know that a negative report against a mortgage is a killer to your credit. I have not been contacted by XXXX XXXX and am pleading for help with this company that has the absolute worst reputation in the industry.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,Experian Information Solutions Inc.,FL,334XX,,Consent provided,Web,13/03/2019,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,3178581

Mortgage,FHA mortgage,Trouble during payment process,,"In XXXX of XXXX I filed bankruptcy due to falling behind on mortgage payments. US Bank increased my payments almost {$200.00} without an explanation. Whenever I called the bank NONE of their employees were educated on the tax process and how this could have happen.I made several attempts to contact US Bank to resolve prior to filing, and each time I spoke to multiple employees who NEVER provided the correct information. I was able to successfully bring my mortgage current and have attempted since to stay on time with my payments. Unfortunately US Bank is making it almost impossible for me to make my payments on time. If I call in to make a payment they will charge an {$11.00} fee. when I asked for another option I was told I can go online and make a payment. when I log into the main website for US bank it provides the correct information. Once I select the option to make a payment it automatically directs me to an alternate website that states my loan is delinquent and they will not accept payments on my loan at this time via the online payment method. MY LOAN IS NOT PAST DUE When I called and provided this information to a representative, the rep advised that I would have to send a letter stating I accept the receipt of e-statements. E-STATEMENTS HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH MAKING A PAYMENT ONLINE. I'm also already enrolled in E-STATEMENTS I sent my XXXX and XXXX payments to US Bank via my XXXX XXXX XXXX bill pay. US Bank RECEIVED the XXXX payment on XX/XX/XXXX and the XXXX payment was RECEIVED on XX/XX/XXXX neither of my payments have been updated. My loan is showing due for a XX/XX/XXXX payment. this is incorrect and when I called in I'm being told US Bank is not showing proof of payment. Although my loan was DISCHARGED in  Bankruptcy, US Bank sent me an email requesting PAYMENT for XX/XX/XXXX. Clearly in violation of my rights after having this loan discharged in a  bankruptcy. Yet they are using tactics to garner fee income.

Mortgage,Conventional home mortgage,Closing on a mortgage,,"We started a mortgage process with TD Bank on XX/XX/XXXX, to purchase a condo in XXXX, NY for my daughters. We never shopped around because my daughter was very happy with TD services in the past 10 years. At the beginning, they offered a 30 year old mortgage with no points at 3.5 % fixed rate. Upon request, we provided all necessary documents TD asked for and through-out the process, we requested the closing to take place by XX/XX/XXXX since my daughters had to move out of their current apartment as others were scheduled to move in the next day. TD Bank consistently assured us that the closing WILL take place on time. To our surprise, a week before the closing date, TD started asking for the same documents that we had provided and waited to the last week for employment verification which they couldve done at the very beginning. The loan officer apologized for late handling and processing the case via email and phone calls. TD abject failure to deliver what was promised, caused the closing date to be postponed TWICE which caused us extreme hardship and added costs of living in a hotel for 4 nights and I had to postpone my flight twice. 
But, the most egregious part of the entire ordeal was when TD Bank inexplicably increased the interest rate to 4 % even-though we had a locked-in rate of 3.625 %, literally two days before the closing and after hundreds of phone calls, emails and texts begging them to honor what was agreed upon, they wouldnt budge and presented some bogus and questionable reasoning and justification. We strongly feel that TD kept us hostage and knowing that we had our belongings in a truck and living in a hotel, we had no other choice but to accept their unfair deal since we couldnt walk away. This was nothing but an extortion which I brought up to the attention of most TD staff including the Regional Sales Manger, but they couldnt care less. 
We even asked for some type of compensation for our additional expenses by a way of waving or reducing some of their fees and charges to no avail. 
Most attorneys and people involved at the closing which finally took place on XX/XX/XXXX, five days later than promised, all had negative comments about TD services due to their past experiences, particularly TD Mortgage Division.",,TD BANK US HOLDING COMPANY,FL,,,Consent provided,Web,6/08/2019,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,3331820

There were several inaccurate items listed on the collection accounts from XXXX XXXX. Equifax sent back statements that said it was verified. I did not ask Equifax to verify the accounts. I asked Equifax to send me documentation or the proof they had since they stated it was verified. According to my records the items are not reporting accurately and must be removed. 

I sent Equifax letters asking I've asked Equifax to send me verification in XX/XX/XXXX of who they spoke to since it says, it was verified and they sent a credit report back in XX/XX/XXXX without verification which is what I requested. They changed the amount on the collections. Where did they get that amount from? Who are they speaking to? They are obviously not complying with the law. I am aware the law mandates them to comply with a consumer requests if they can can not provide the documentation or they must delete and they have failed to do comply with the law multiple times.

This complaint involves the following GR employees XXXX XXXX ( VP of Mortgage Lending ) ( "" XXXX '' ), XXXX XXXX ( Loan Coordinator ) ( "" XXXX '' ), and XXXX XXXX ( "" XXXX '' ) ( Production Manager ). 

After a number of other mishaps during the pre-closing process, we were first told that XXXX finally submitted our application to the real lender this past Friday ( XX/XX/XXXX ). We were scheduled to close today ( XX/XX/XXXX ). Despite assuring us on Friday that we were "" on track '' to close on time, XXXX and XXXX failed to disclose of mistakes delaying our close. They then failed to answer direct questions -- on Friday, Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday -- about when documents were sent so that we could evaluated whether closing needed to be moved and seek and extension from the sellers. Finally, at XXXX Wednesday XXXX -- hours before we were scheduled to close -- XXXX told me via a phone call that XXXX had mistakenly sent documentation to XXXX rather than the investor, XXXX XXXX, and that it lead to the delay. She then promised to provide me details in writing by the next morning so that I could assuage the sellers ' concerns and obtain an extension. 

On Thursday ( XX/XX/XXXX ), I received a call from XXXX informing me that the information provided by XXXX -- which I had shared with the sellers as we tried to work towards delaying the closing at the last minute -- was incorrect. In fact, no information had been sent to XXXX. Rather, when the XXXX XXXX underwriter had returned the file to GR on XX/XX/XXXX, it had done so with a direction that the property appraisal be sent to collateral underwriting. GR ignored that direction until it finally sent the appraisal over to collateral review on XX/XX/XXXX at XXXX XXXX. This was not disclosed to us until my call with XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX at XXXX. 

On that same call, XXXX assured me that there would only be a 3-4 hour turnaround once approval from XXXX XXXX was received because our filed would be in "" rush '' protocol for GR. Coincidentally, XXXX XXXX sent over approval by collateral review just after our call, around XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX. XXXX left me a voicemail that afternoon indicating they had received approval and would "" work on a closing for tomorrow on a rush. '' Despite those promises, as of XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX the file is still "" in line '' to be reviewed by underwriting. The sellers are now threatening not to extend the contract. XXXX is backtracking on his promises yesterday, saying in a XX/XX/XXXX XXXX e-mail to me that "" I never once said we were closing today.

Student loan,Federal student loan servicing,Dealing with your lender or servicer,Received bad information about your loan,"In addition to my TEACH Grants being wrongfully converted to loans in XXXX of XXXX, my loans have now been turned over to the US Department of Education for default. I am NOT in default. According to the most recent escalated rep that I spoke with on XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, my loans were put in default on XX/XX/XXXX as a result of an error on their behalf. As XXXX, an escalated rep in the XXXX XXXX explained, the method by which they refunded money to me for payments made to grants, threw my loans into default. As she explained on XX/XX/XXXX, this is "" A big mess '', and it is by no fault of yours. '' I understand that the loans now must go to the "" XXXX XXXX '' and there is no timeline for the "" mess '' to be corrected. Meanwhile, my credit is trashed, and there is no estimated timeline that can be provided to me for the correction to occur. 
The numerous reps that I have spoken with since XXXX regarding my grants, Income-driven payment request, and public loan forgiveness program, have all given me contradictory information, and I have no faith in anyone I speak with there regarding my status on any of the above listed processes. For example, in XXXX, I had an escalated rep guide me through the Income-driven repayment application, wait on the phone until I completed the application, and uploaded to my online account. The next time I spoke with them regarding my expected refund for grant payments, I was told that the refund would not be issued, and that the payments would be credited to the overall loan amount. Yet, I was told in XXXX that I would be receiving a check by XX/XX/XXXX. During that same conversation, I took the opportunity to explain how I was exhausted from having to make numerous calls that usually exceeded 40 minutes, only to have to start over explaining the issues and repeating what I had been told on the previous conversation. Consistently, I was told that I was given incorrect information by previous rep. If it were not the truth, and if it did not cause stress, it would be comical - like a XXXX XXXX XXXX skit. Every rep provided different information regarding the same topic, even among escalated reps ( that I demanded to deal with every call since XXXX ). I complained about how it took 45 minutes and an escalated rep to teach me how to complete my IDR request so that I was not overcharged, and how upset I was that I had paid excessive payments for years because the application did not allow for me to correctly document my financial situation. In other words, I told the rep that the application "" baits '' you in to documenting income and spouse information that is not correct, but you are scared not to document it like that because of the liability you are subject to for filing false information. I told him how thankful I was that 5 years in to filing IDRs and making payments, someone was competent enough, and cared enough, to guide me through the application to get payment lowered where it should be. When I described that situation, the representative said that my IDR request provided "" false '' information, and that it could get me in trouble! I explained again that an escalated rep walked me through it, and waited on the phone for me to upload it and it be received. He said he can see where that happened, but unfortunately the rep gave me incorrect information. He said I could keep the payment where it is for now, but that I would have to file it differently if my husband and I file taxes jointly.

"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports",Other personal consumer report,Problem with a company's investigation into an existing issue,Their investigation did not fix an error on your report,"I have been actively requesting for verification of a derogatory public record that the credit bureau Experian has been reporting on my credit profile. I have sent numerous certified letters and have yet to receive any compliance in my request. I started the process of rebuilding my credit in XX/XX/XXXX and was told per request that the reporting was accurate. I sent a letter to the United States Bankruptcy Court to verify the correspondence with Experian and received notice by the clerk stating the following "" the Courts does not report information to credit agencies ''. This was confusing as I had received confirmation that the reporting was accurate. Feeling discouraged I felt helpless and gave up my efforts to correct this wrong. In XX/XX/XXXX I started the process again felling more determined. I found information that the credit bureaus had been using "" Third Party Companies '' to verify my information and not the original consumer. I sent a series of four rounds of dispute letters to both Experian & XXXX requesting verification of the bankruptcy reporting on my credit profile along with copies from the Bankruptcy courts. I also found the some of the names of the third party consumers ( XXXX XXXX & XXXX XXXX ) and sent letters to freeze accounts that I was unaware even existed with my personal information. The last request I sent to Experian for the verification procedure incurred me a letter from, XXXX XXXX, another consumer company that also contians my sensitive personal information. By XX/XX/XXXX i received confirmation from XXXX  that the erroneous reporting was deleted from my credit report while Experian continuously failed to do so. I sent a fifth round to Experian along with copies from XXXX showing that an error was made and corrected by deleting the account from my report. Still Experian continues to claim that they have complied in my request. I will be seeking council if this matter continues and need to have this matter brought to light to expose the wrong that i have endured to protect people from going through the same hardships.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,Experian Information Solutions Inc.,TX,752XX,,Consent provided,Web,19/04/2019,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,3217554

I asked if there was another card that Capital One can offer which does not carry the late fee.

I have also contacted them on the phone and through mail. I haven't receive anything showing me a dispute or anything in that nature. By law i was suppose to receive something as early as 30 days after the first letter was sent in XXXX of 2019. I am sending this letter as of my final attempt to fairly allow you to do your job and kindly remove the errors that are reporting on my credit report. I've mentioned that i am a victim of identity theft. My information was also leaked in several breaches over the years but a recent one a few weeks in XXXX of 2019. Since it comes to my attention that you aren't responding maybe we should settle in court, which will work for me and i won't be wasting my time. I complied the evidence and paper work during the time when i sent in my letters and more. 

This letter is being sent to you in response to a computer generated, unsigned letter dated XX/XX/2019 XXXX XXXX ), letter received by Claimant from your offices. Be advised that your claim is disputed and validation and proof of claim of the disputed debt is requested in accordance with the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, 15 USC 1692 and as amended by adding the following new Title 8 USC 802 et seq., and the Fair Credit Billing Act, 15 USC. 1666 et seq. All of which work in conjunction with each other, including the Truth In Lending Act ( TILA ) 15 USC 1601 et seq. It is not now, nor has it ever been, my intention to avoid paying any obligation that is lawfully owed by the Claimant. In order to make arrangements to pay an obligation which may be lawfully owed, please document and verify the debt by complying, in good faith, with this request for validation and return it to me, within thirty ( 30 ) days of receipt of this letter. 
This is NOT a request for verification or proof of Claimant mailing address, but a request for VALIDATION and PROOF OF CLAIM made pursuant to the above named Titles and Sections. I respectfully request that your offices provide Claimant with competent evidence as per the attached Declaration and Proof of Claim that I have any legal obligation to pay you the unsubstantiated alleged debt. Furthermore you shall cease all verbal communication. No phone calls to the Claimant. 
At this time I will also inform you that if your offices have reported invalidated information to any of the 3 major Credit Bureaus, such as, XXXX, XXXX and XXXX prior to validation and proof of claim of the disputed debt, this action might constitute fraud under both Federal and State Laws. Due to this fact ; if any negative mark is found on any of Claimant credit reports by your company or the company that you represent I will not hesitate in bringing legal action against you and your client for the following : Violation of the Fair Credit Reporting Act Violation of the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act Defamation of Character Violation of United States Code TITLE 18 PART 1 CHAPTER 63 1341 ( Mail Fraud ) This debt is considered to be invalid until I receive proper validation and your offices provide Claimant with proof of claim of the disputed debt. Your offices have 30 days to produce the required documentation in accordance with FTC guidelines. During this validation period and proof of claim, if any action is taken which could be considered detrimental to any of Claimant credit reports, said action will be considered a dishonor and cause the self-executing contract portion of this notice to be implemented. This includes any listing any information to a credit reporting repository that could be inaccurate or invalidated. 
If your offices fail to respond to this validation and proof of claim request within 30 days from the date of your receipt, all references to this account must be deleted and completely removed from Claimant credit file and a copy of such deletion request shall be sent to Claimant immediately.

Again, XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX is the crooked company who stole my family 's home at the auction, and is paying BIG money to Attorney XXXX XXXX # XXXX to continuously harass my family and me by sending us threatening letters, and phone calls attempting to steal our home and throw us out into the street. Of course this was at the direction of Wells Fargo. Had my magnificent Mother, XXXX XXXX XXXX, who is the account holder had been alive, she would have been XXXX years old on XX/XX/XXXX of this year. Wells Fargo, was continuously harassing my Mother when she was alive, threatening her with notices, which increased her stress level, causing her to become ill and unfortunately passed away a few years ago. My Mother had a lawsuit in place against Wells Fargo for unfairly taking advantage of her as a senior, and practicing predatory lending practices against her. Unfortunately, Wells Fargo was trying to throw my XXXX year old Mother into the street. Go figure ... Presently, Wells Fargo has teamed up with several of their cohorts to attempt to destroy our families dream. Quite naturally, this TRILLION dollar company is steadily denying any wrongdoing whatsoever. This is how Wells Fargo has managed to become a trillion dollar predatory lender due to the fact that this horrific company has attempted to steal the dreams of middle class families illegally, committing fraud for many years forcing middle class families out of the homes, which is why the former CEO of Wells Fargo, whose name is XXXX XXXX XXXX has be forced to step down by Congresswoman XXXX XXXX. It appears, however, that the general counsel who has interimly taken over as CEO, XXXX XXXX XXXX, appears to be just as crooked as XXXX XXXX XXXX. Wells Fargo needs to be shut down, and many other class action lawsuits should be filed repeatedly, and dismantle this TRILLION dollar corrupt lender, until they file bankruptcy, which I am positive will be transpiring very soon. I will have the editors of prominent newspapers, and the eyewitness news to broadcast how the corrupt attorneys who are on Wells Fargo 's payroll AKA XXXX XXXX, and the infamous attorney XXXX XXXX XXXX, # XXXX in Cahoots with XXXX XXXX XXXXd XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX, who actually conducted the illegal sale of our home, and others. Wells Fargo, you need to surrender, and give my family and opportunity to stay in our Mother 's home, and not attempt to steal our family 's legacy ... .Wells Fargo XXXX al., Attorney XXXX XXXX XXXX Attorney XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX, how can you sleep at night, knowing that you are destroying and dismantling families all over this state and the nation?",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,WELLS FARGO & COMPANY,CA,90016,,Consent provided,Web,30/05/2019,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,3257978

In no way am I comfortable sending several copies of my signature to a company whose business it is to unscrupulously collect debt from consumers. This is against the law because it is the plaintiff 's burden to validate debt. The court is not enforcing this and they both have the upper hand because they know the law and I do not. It is my opinion that the court and the credit collector are using fear and intimidation tactics to unlawfully gain money knowing that I am a layman in matters of law.

Vehicle loan or lease,Lease,Managing the loan or lease,Billing problem,GM Financial 's website for billing has been reporting incorrectly for the almost 3 years I have leased a car. It continually shows the wrong amount due and incorrect due dates. Example : Login to the webpage it shows amount due as {$310.00} then look at the electronic statement and it shows {$290.00}. Consumers would be unsure as to what amount is actually due. Now at the end of the lease it shows {$750.00} due and no statement for XX/XX/XXXX. I called and they said I only owe {$140.00} ( which I paid ). I do not trust this company at all and I'm sure there will be more charges even though they tell me this XXXX 's out my account. This is very confusing and I have been very diligent to pay attention to statement amounts instead of the website but I'm worried that others would incur late payments and other financial hardships based on misinformation. This is very bad business. When I asked about this several times the only answer I got was they are working on it or they don't know why it shows this. I have talked to other GM financial customers who have similar stories. This needs to be investigated for predatory lending practices.

Credit card or prepaid card,General-purpose credit card or charge card,"Other features, terms, or problems",Problem with customer service,"This complaint is in conjunction with complaint XXXX. Initially I was unable to use my card for several months upon credit approval. Several attempts to contact hsbc and several hours of being put on hold and hung up on lead to my initial complaint.

Now, I have completed the online banking months ago as well to manage my account. HSBCs initial classificationof my account has caused me not to have the ability to log on, I have also stopped receiving paper letters in the mail showing me my statement. Since opening I have made one payment over the phone for the complete balance. However now I do not know the remaining payments or due dates which is preventing me to make my payment and ensure I have a XXXX  balance. 

I hurt my credit by opening this account with the intention of using rewards points, benefiting from the annual match of points, using my rewards points, and benefiting from the 0 % transfer. 

I was forced to open an additional card to perform the balance transfer, further harming my credit score. I am unable to use my rewards points because I can not log online. I have been prevented from using my card for several months limiting the benefit I would receive in rewards points and more importantly the annual match. I can not make a payment on this account due to unknown balances which I have never had a late payment and am afraid this may occur due to the mismanagement of opening this account. 

In addition to the hours spent already in the aforementioned complaint I spent additional hours trying to fix my online banking issues. I have attempted several days to contact customer service and resolve this issue. They continue to transfer me from to different departments until I drop from the conversation. Attached are additional documents of me attempting to open my online activity. 

In the aforementioned complaint HSBCs response rewarded me with {$100.00} in rewards points. This is an inadequate amount based on the harm this experience has caused to me credit score and the inability to use the benefits of the card which is why I opened it. Additionally, I can not use any of the rewards I was provided because I can not log on to my accounts although several customer service agents confirmed I opened my online accounts correctly.",,HSBC NORTH AMERICA HOLDINGS INC.,CO,806XX,,Consent provided,Web,21/12/2018,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,3106996

"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports",Credit reporting,Problem with a credit reporting company's investigation into an existing problem,Problem with personal statement of dispute,"To Whom It May Concern : Both XXXX  and Transunion began to report an unpaid debt on my account in the amount of {$130.00} to XXXX XXXX XXXX around XX/XX/2018. This is stunning, since XXXX  checked into my dispute regarding this account and removed it immediately. Both XXXX and Transunion, however, refused despite several phone calls and dispute filings. I do not owe that company any money. I have never missed a credit card or loan payment in my entire life, and these credit reporting companies have now reported an unpaid delinquent debt that cost me about 50 points on their credit report. I asked the credit reporting companies whether there is a judgment against me of any kind with respect to this debt. Neither XXXX  nor Transunion could find any such judgment. Nevertheless, they stated that XXXX XXXX XXXX claimed I owed money, and that was the end of the inquiry. I asked why my statement that I did not owe any money would not be held in the same regard as that company 's statement. But these companies had no valid answer. 

Furthermore, Transunion continued to add a suffix to my name that does not exist over my objection. XXXX  did the same thing. I disputed this with them, but only Transunion fixed the error. XXXX  refused, demanding personal information, which I was unwilling to send them due to their record of records ' breach ( which impacted me ). They stated  one company ( out of 50 accounts ) reported my name as XXXX, and they would take that company 's word over mine and that of 49 companies.  This was stunning, and to this day, the company continues to hold me out as someone I am not. 

I hope you can fix this!

"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports",Credit reporting,Improper use of your report,Reporting company used your report improperly,"I received an email from XXXX XXXX XXXX on XXXX XXXX. I filled out a web form requesting a rate for a conventional loan. A loan officer contacted me and I gave him my information for a conventional loan. Much of the conversation was about him trying to get me to apply for an fha. I stated numerous times that I was already approved for an fha mortgage and that I did not want to consider an fha application. 
The loan officer stated that it didn't matter and that he could check on a conventional. 
After pulling my credit report he said that he could not qualify me for an fha for the amount that I wanted and I should not trust the preapproval 's I have received from the other lenders. Regardless that the other lenders have approved me based on verification of my assets and income and have been approved by underwriting. I said I didn't want to apply for an fha and that I would not be moving forward with their company. I filed a dispute with credit dispute with credit plus for the credit inquiry. The credit inquiry did not harm my credit score but the fact that this company requested an inquiry for a loan product ( conventional ) that they were never had the intent to approve me for I requested that they remove the inquiry from my report. 
I received a letter from credit plus with a response from XXXX XXXX XXXX   XXXX through Credit plus from XXXX XXXX. The letter states that I applied for a mortgage over the phone with XXXX XXXX and that I gave verbal authorization for the credit report authorization. He further states I withdrew the application as they were not able to approve me for the amount that I desired. The truth is that I was applying for a conventional loan but the XXXX mortgage forms that they sent to the response has FHA checked off. In the box for assets it shows how much I had for a down payment and closing which was much larger than what I had stated I would use for the loan early in the process. Reason I withdrew was because that they were not offering the product I had requested I did not want to pay the fees involved with an FHA I could have increased my down payment to meet a DTI requirement. The false information that was being relayed from XXXX XXXX ( bait and switch tactics ) and I could not trust him nor his company is the reason I withdrew my application.",,Credit Plus Inc,IL,601XX,Servicemember,Consent provided,Web,22/01/2019,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,3130643
"Payday loan, title loan, or personal loan",Installment loan,Incorrect information on your report,Information belongs to someone else,"I have addressed this fraudulent account previously with both CFPB as well as The Lending Club, unfortunately, the complaint is closed by CFPB immediately upon receiving a response from the company regardless if the issue remains unresolved. This is not an account opened by me. The company responded in XX/XX/2017, indicating that I have not provided them with the required documentation, which is FALSE. I have been in contact with your investigators and have submitted all the information above once again on XX/XX/2017. On XX/XX/2017, I was contacted via email by Mr. XXXX XXXX, who stated he had not received the requested affidavit, I reminded Mr. XXXX that the required documents were sent to his inbox ( XXXX ) on XX/XX/2017. Mr. XXXX responded and stated that he required an incident report be filed as well, I replied informing Mr. XXXX that an incident report was not something I could furnish as per my notarized agreement with the Individual responsible, ( which I provided to the Lending Club ), in exchange for her admittance, I would not file charges. I have not heard from Mr. XXXX, nor any representative from The Lending Club since. The Lending Club has a copy of the signed agreement and all documentation, so I am unsure why they are requesting me to violate a notorized statement. 

This situation has dragged on for many years, and I am desperate to put it behind me. I am willing to work with the company, as I've always been, to come up with an agreement to resolve this issue once and for all. The entire ordeal of having someone extremely close to me cause such chaos, and turmoil in my life financially, mentally, emotionally and professionally has been tough to move past, especially with the remnants of her actions lingering on my credit report, military, and XXXX XXXX record. I ask The Lending Club to work with me to come to an agreement that is both fair and satisfactory to both, the company and myself so this situation can be put to an end once and for all. 

I look forward to hearing from representatives of your company.

Vehicle loan or lease,Loan,Managing the loan or lease,Billing problem,"I had an auto loan with BB & T. That is who the car dealer went through I suppose. Last month my bank ( XXXX XXXX XXXX ) wanted to take the loan as I do all of my other business with them. All the arrangements were made, received the payoff amount and the deal was done. XXXX paid off my loan with BB & T and took over my loan. I received a refund check from BB & T around XX/XX/19 for over payment of the loan in the amount of {$13.00}. Soon after that, I received the verification letter from BB & T stating that my loan was paid off. This letter was dated XX/XX/19. On XX/XX/19 BB & T took another payment of {$490.00} for my loan that was already paid off. I tried calling them but the contact numbers that they have listed are almost impossible to navigate to a real person. Spent about an hour and a half calling and trying to get through to someone. I started posting on their XXXX page what had happened and got a response from a XXXX. She had said to send an email to them ( and gave me an email address ) with all of my information. I sent it and have not heard anything from them. This is my money. I consider it theft. They took money that did not belong to them and I would expect that they would get it it reversed just as fast as if they would have made a mistake in my favor.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,BB&T CORPORATION,NV,891XX,,Consent provided,Web,14/11/2019,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,3438290

________________________________________ Your tracking number ( XXXX  ) is : XXXX Transaction Date : XX/XX/XXXX XXXX ET. 

Recd alert from XXXX XXXX of credit filing of delinquency ; contacted Rushmore. They said they never received payment ; I gave them all the information of the receipt of submitting. I've called numerous times and they kept saying they never received. Gave them the tracking # I had. 
There is no one else I can speak with ; there is no email address that can be used to communicate and deliver documentation. Either fax or regular mail. No attempt on their part to track receipt of said money using the information provided. 
rec 'd another statement dated XX/XX/XXXX indicating owing {$0.00}. Again I called and resubmitted the information regarding payment information ; they replied they had no way to track it, as they never received. Another notification of now the delinquency of over 60 days. 
XX/XX/XXXX - another call to Rushmore asking for assistance of tracking my payment and resolving the credit reporting. Still no assistance in helping. Therefore, I went to my bank and REWIRED ANOTHER PAYMENT. 
XX/XX/XXXX - XXXX CST resent ANOTHER wire transfer with an additional cost to me of {$25.00} -- Also, contacted XXXX XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX and they have record from XXXX , Rushmore Loan Management Services received funds XX/XX/XXXX. Trace # is XXXX. 

XX/XX/XXXX - again called Rushmore to give them information that I just wired ANOTHER PAYMENT and was told to call back on Friday, XX/XX/XXXX to verify they received. 
XX/XX/XXXX - called and they verified payment received and closed account. I asked about next step in resolving credit reporting and also let them know they now have received TWO payments from me. Gave them additional information again for THEIR bank with a tracking # XXXX. Their records indicate a follow up is needed by me next Wednesday, XX/XX/XXXX. 

Asked them to report to credit agencies their reporting that the account was not delinquent which affected my CREDIT SCORE greatly. They indicated they would send to consumer affairs department for investigation however it is still under investigation. They offer no customer service to assist in rectifying the situation other than the customer doing all the calling ; following up. I was told to call XX/XX/XXXX, or I can mail/fax communication and wait again for reply. There is no other communication other than the one customer service line and you are unable to speak with anyone else ; no supervisor or anyone other than the rep on the phone. 

This loan was first taken from XXXX XXXX XXXX  and the account was turned over in XX/XX/XXXX to Rushmore Loan. In six years paying the mortgage for a payoff amount of {$0.00} this company has ruined my credit and is making no attempts to assist in correcting the problem. 

As of today XX/XX/XXXX, Rushmore has now an additional {$73.00} due to the double payment in which they can not tell me how or when the payment will be reissued back to me. Again, no one to speak with at all to assist in resolving issue. 

I have made every attempt possible to rectify the situation with no assistance whatsoever from Rushmore other than being treated like an individual who is trying NOT to pay a {$0.00} debt when I clearly paid a {$15000.00} debt I owed timely. 

I am looking for restitution of my {$73.00} over payment ; in addition to clearing my credit report of false information.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,RUSHMORE LOAN MANAGEMENT SERVICES LLC,LA,700XX,,Consent provided,Web,21/03/2019,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,3180696
